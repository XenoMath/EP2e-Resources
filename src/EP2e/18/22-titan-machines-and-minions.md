# TITAN Machines & Minions

The TITANs deployed numerous minions and deadly machines during the Fall, many of which remain and are still hostile.

## Fetch

<div class="stat-list">

- _TITAN_
- **Threat Level:** Ultraviolet
- **Niche:** Earth, Quarantine Zones, TITAN artifacts
- **Numbers:** 1

</div>

Fetches are the software agents of the TITANs. Each is a fork of a TITAN ASI, though lobotomized by comparison, trimmed down to the bare necessities to maneuver among transhuman mesh networks and morphs. Though hyper-intelligent, fetches are prone to erratic behavior, either from the pruning process, distance from their parent mind, or exsurgent infection.

**Motivation:** +TITAN Interests. Most were deployed to manage long-term projects that required direct oversight, but were too unimportant or dangerous for a TITAN to attend to personally. Some function far beyond their operational parameters.

**Use:** Fetches are clever, forward-thinking, and devious foes — if sometimes unstable. They make their home in advanced servers or enhanced-intelligence morphs, fielding minion AIs, puppets, and machines to serve their purposes.

## Fractal

<div class="stat-list">

- _TITAN, Medium Size_
- **Threat Level:** Ultraviolet
- **Niche:** Active TITAN Sites, Earth, Quarantine Zones
- **Numbers:** 1–2

</div>

Fractals are “bush robots:” conglomerations of jointed, metallic, fractal branches, surrounded by a shimmering haze of active nanotech. Innocuous appearances aside, they are dangerous adversaries, as they are advanced mobile disassembly and nanofabrication machines. Using trillions of nanomanipulators, fractals can dismantle anything they touch and fab armaments and gear at incredible speeds. They are surprisingly hardy: projectiles are broken down and absorbed, severed branches are rapidly reconstructed, and seemingly destroyed fractals rebuild.

**Motivation:** +Defend Territory +TITAN Interests −Transhumanity. Lacking direct orders, fractals lie dormant, driving off intruders as necessary. They are known to construct unusual devices and formations, though whether these are art or high-tech installations is debatable.

**Use:** Fractals can and will fab whatever gear they need, given time, including other fractals. They are smart opponents, hiding and tracking their prey, testing capabilities, building traps, and withdrawing when necessary, only to return with the gear necessary to finish them off.

- **Exsurgent Infection:** Fractals are often infected with the exsurgent virus and carry or nanofabricate nanoplagues
- **Feign Destruction:** Fractals are programmed to “Fall apart” when accumulated damage nears their Death Rating, dissolving into numerous nanoswarms that rebuild the fractal
- **Invulnerability:** Area-effect weapons do half-damage to fractals; all others do minimum damage
- **Nanofabrication:** Fractals may be equipped with or fabricate any enhancements, gear, armor, or weapons the GM desires to present an appropriate threat to the PCs. Reduce all [nanofabrication](../16/03-nanofabrication.md) times by half. They may also mimic the effects of any existing [nanoswarm](../16/20-nanoswarms-and-microswarms.md) or [TITAN Nanoviruses](21-the-titans-legacy.md#titan-nanoviruses).
- **Regeneration:** Fractals repair 1d10 damage per half hour; after all damage is fixed, they repair 1 wound per hour

## Headhunter

<div class="stat-list">

- _TITAN, Small Size_
- **Threat Level:** Orange
- **Niche:** Earth, Quarantine Zones
- **Numbers:** 6–12

</div>

These insectoid machines are designed to grasp onto a victim’s skull, saw through the neck, and remove the head for forced uploading at a specialized facility. The TITANs deployed them in massive swarms in cities during the Fall.

**Motivation:** +Collect Egos +TITAN Interests −Transhumanity

**Use:** Headhunters attack in groups; once a head is harvested, that headhunter withdraws from the fight and deposits its prize at a (former) uploading station.

</blockquote>

## Puppet

<div class="stat-list">

- _TITAN, Medium Size_
- **Threat Level:** Yellow
- **Niche:** Earth, Quarantine Zones, Transhuman Habitats
- **Numbers:** 1–8

</div>

Puppets are transhumans whose minds were subverted by the TITANs. They are distinct from exsurgents in that they are not infected and are typically under direct TITAN (or fetch) control. Most puppets possess hacked cyberbrains; some were created through illicit psychosurgery. During the Fall, they infiltrated all walks of transhuman life, inflicting devastating deception and treachery, and some sleeper agents still remain.

**Motivation:** +Infiltrate +TITAN Interests −Transhumanity

**Use:** Some puppets were targets of opportunity, others were created to facilitate specific tasks or objectives, sometimes years in advance. They are used to undermine defenses, transport TITAN nanoswarms, infect air-gapped networks, inflict basilisk hacks, or even as suicide bombers. Many of them do not even realize they have been subverted, due to [awareness block psychosurgery](../15/06-psychosurgery-procedures.md#awareness-block).

## Self-Replicating Nanoswarm

<div class="stat-list">

- _TITAN_
- **Threat Level:** Ultraviolet
- **Niche:** Earth, Quarantine Zones
- **Numbers:** 1 swarm

</div>

TITAN nanoswarms are generations ahead of transhuman nanotechnology. They are autonomous, sapient, and self-replicating. They can modify themselves to perform any nanoswarm function and can nanofabricate almost anything with time and feedstock. They can also link together into a physical lattice in order to create large-scale physical forms and mechanisms. Self-replicators are almost impossible to entirely destroy with anything short of antimatter weaponry; if even a few nanobots survive, the entire swarm can rebuild and adapt accordingly.

**Motivation:** +TITAN Interests. Without direction, most nanoswarms stick to the locations of their last deployment, occasionally migrating to “feed” on new matter. Some occupy themselves with building arcane structures that may be art, whimsically transforming the landscape, or floating as clouds and altering atmospheric properties and weather patterns.

**Use:** A TITAN nanoswarm is a WMD, area-denial weapon, cyberwarfare suite, plague, and weapons factory all rolled into one. They can just as easily camouflage themselves, quietly dissembling anything that enters the death zone, as they can construct artillery and launch precision bombardment kilometers away. They will scan opponents to develop effective weapons and defenses.

### Self-Replicating Nanoswarm

- **Stress Test:** SV 1d6

---

- **Initiative:** 8 • **Fray:** 40 • **AV:** 0/0
- **WT:** — • **DUR:** 70 • **DR:** 140
- **Insight:** 6, **Moxie:** 0, **Vigor:** 4, **Flex:** 3

---

- **Disassembly:** DV 1d6 per action turn to anything within swarm; armor protects but AV is reduced
- **Fuel-Air Explosive:** The nanoswarm creates tiny floating bubbles filled with fuel, disperses uniformly over an area, and ignites it. DV 3d10 +5, uniform area effect (10 meters), armor-piercing, knockdown. Fabbing a new FAE takes 12 hours.
- **Snare and Stab:** 60 ([Grappling](../12/02-melee-combat.md#grappling)); the swarm locks together into entangling snare lines with gripping teeth, requires a superior success. Grappled victims get no defense to piercing needles that spurt on subsequent turns; DV 1d10, armor does not apply.

---

- **Nanoswarm:** Functions like a [nanoswarm](../16/20-nanoswarms-and-microswarms.md), except can move normally in vacuum and does not require a nanohive
- **Nanofabrication:** Can nanofabricate items in half the time as transhuman nanofabricators; can replicate effects of any nanoswarm at will
- **Self-Repair:** Automatically repair 1d10 damage per hour
- **Take Form:** Can cohere/dissipate simple physical/mechanical forms (arms, mobility systems, tentacles, cages, traps, etc) with a complex action; these may take physical actions such as Fray or Melee Tests

- **Gear:** 10 splash grenades with various nanoswarms

---

- **Notes:** Other common weapon systems include plasma rifles, particle beam bolters, and buzzers (with disassembler swarms)
- **Shockwave Shield:** Warbots can calculate the impact point of an explosive projectile or shockwave and create a temporary superheated pocket of air with a laser-generated electric arc that will absorb the blast. This provides 20 points of energy armor against blast effects, including seekers and grenades. This is only effective against attacks the warbot has spotted, and may only be used against one attack per action turn. This shockwave shield has 20 uses before it must be recharged, which takes 2 hours.
