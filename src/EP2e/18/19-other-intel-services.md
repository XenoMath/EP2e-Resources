# Other Intel Services

Most polities have their own intelligence service, either as a formal branch of government or as a volunteer group of operatives and hackers. These groups range in expertise, motivation, and funding. Some of the more notable include:

## Fleet Intelligence

**(TITANIANS)**

As part of the Titanian Ministry of Defense, Commonwealth Fleet Intelligence (CFI) supports the Commonwealth’s naval operations throughout the system. Their purview includes electronic and nano warfare, surveillance, and military intelligence. Fleet Intelligence agents are authorized to conduct mesh intrusions, maintain HUMINT espionage networks, and embed themselves as moles or sleeper agents. CFI is liberal about their use of psychosurgery to create agents with the skill sets and memories needed for the mission.

The Commonwealth keeps a tight rein on military operations, and the CFI is bound by Commonwealth laws and treaties. Because CFI is not a police force, it will only use armed response against valid military targets during a sanctioned conflict. However, CFI will leverage its expertise to investigate non-military threats, including international criminal rings and x-risks, which it can then hand over to the appropriate authorities.

## ISET

**(ARGONAUTS)**

To the public and even most Argonauts, the Institute for the Study of Emergent Trends is known as a data collection/monitoring service for various research projects. In reality, the group takes on a clandestine role for the Argonauts. Its Project Peacock is one of the most comprehensive signals collection and analysis operations in the Solar System, working primarily through the Long Array on Saturn’s moon Dione to intercept and crack communications. Its Apollo Project analyzes and predicts future trends, with results that border on the supernatural. ISET assets take a light touch, with most field agents specializing in data collection or counterintelligence. ISET is guarded and supported by the Medeans, the Argonauts’ secret paramilitary force, and has a very close relationship with Firewall.

## JSFI

**(JOVIANS)**

The Jovian Republic has nearly a dozen agencies dedicated to domestic and foreign spying, the most important of which is Jovian Space Force Intelligence. JSFI is responsible for all foreign and military intelligence, including investigations and containment actions involving TITANs, exsurgent outbreaks, terrorism, and rival political factions. JSFI assets are highly motivated. Many Jovians believe an ego that has left its original morph is a soulless copy, a dead echo of the original. Regardless, JSFI agents resleeve and farcast as a regular part of their duties. JSFI agents show a high occurrences of PTSD and Ego Separation Identity Disorder (ESID). As untethered entities, they have no reservations about committing any action required of them by their nation.

JSFI agents use modern technology not available to other Jovians. Their specific load-out is restricted by three contradictory manuals, but the further they are from home, the less relevant the guidance becomes. JSFI operations are aggressive and set clear goals, usually neutralizing or capturing a specific target. JSFI has little concern for jurisdictions or the well-being of most transhumans. By Jovian philosophy, those people are already dead.

## Oversight

**(PLANETARY CONSORTIUM)**

The Oversight Directorate for Fair and Free Markets acts as an executive agency under the Hypercorp Council to audit hypercorp activities and police any activity considered a threat to economic stability or Consortium operations. Oversight’s focus is domestic financial operations, but it has expanded operations to include foreign intelligence services. Their tactical auditors are the nightmares of any hypercorp or criminal operation. They use surveillance, physical infiltration, digital intrusion, and psychosurgery to root out corruption and free-market threats. Oversight’s new divisions of Counterterrorism and Market Predictions protect Consortium security through police actions, espionage, and forknapping. Oversight enjoys the full weight of the Consortium behind it, but all of its activities must be “by the book.” Their operations have been prosecuted in court by ambitious legal teams.

## Science Police

**(TITANIANS)**

On behalf of the Titanian Ministry of Science, the Science Police (MSP) are responsible for Commonwealth research facilities and research-related crime. They are also responsible for investigating, controlling, and quarantining scientific artifacts and technologies for all projects funded or operated by the Commonwealth or crossing through Titanian space. MSP officers may accompany gatecrashing and zone-stalking teams, and execute sting operations, but otherwise rarely operate under deep cover. Because of the profit and danger in smuggling artifacts, MSP is aggressive and well-equipped.

Of special note for both Firewall and criminals, MSP manages several quarantine zones and an expansive warehouse of seized artifacts. Titan may pull on MSP’s warehouse of goods for specific purposes and to support research efforts. The most dangerous pieces of the collection are under permanent lock-and-key, and may only be accessed on-site and with parliamentary approval.

## Stellar Intelligence

**(PLANETARY CONSORTIUM)**

Stellar Intelligence is the largest hypercorp in the intelligence field. It works strictly on a contractual basis, offering investigations, predictive services, data monitoring, or subscriptions to their databases. Thay are known to approach potential customers with intelligence opportunities (usually data on a rival the customer may wish to exploit or incriminating information they will pay to expunge).

Unlike factional intelligence services, Stellar Intelligence is bound by the bottom line. They will not commit more resources than contracted except to protect their own personnel and property, even if that leaves a job incomplete. They use a lighter touch in polities where litigation might damage lucrative contracts, such as on Mars or Titan. On habitats with fewer ties to their clientèle, Stellar Intelligence will resort to the most economical method of meeting their clients’ needs with no concern for civility or appearances.
