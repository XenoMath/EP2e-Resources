One of the first things you will notice upon rejoining society is that transhumanity is no longer only human. Several non-human species have been raised to sapience and recruited to the club. These can be lumped into two categories, artificial intelligences (AIs) and uplifted animals. Together, they are referred to as _mercurials_.

## Artificial Intelligences

The historical path towards AI was driven by the desire to increase productivity and replace workers with more capable and efficient software and machines. Various methods of machine learning were created that processed large data sets to analyze increasingly complex subjects. Deep-learning neural networks eventually surpassed human capabilities in specific domains such as pattern recognition, translation, bioinformatics, and predictive analysis, but used methods that were structurally and functionally different than biological brains. So-called “unsupervised learning” techniques enabled AIs to process massive amounts of data and run simulations that resulted in non-standard strategies and optimal behaviors. This was followed by developments that sought to create broad intelligence based on biological neural models, yielding actual sentience (self-awareness) and then sapience (reasoning).

Artificial intelligences are categorized by their capability for autonomous action in complex environments.

- **Artificial limited intelligences (ALIs)** are specialized programs designed to perform or assist with a single set of tasks. They fare poorly when forced to apply their learning to a new context. ALI applications and automation feature prominently in financial systems, prediction services, surveillance, fraud detection, manufacturing, medical sciences, personal therapy, online gaming, and the service industry. Almost every complex electronic device comes with a built-in ALI that can provide assistance or operate it independently. Robots, pods, and vehicles piloted by ALIs have been in common use since before the Fall.
- **Artificial general intelligences (AGIs)** are fully aware transhuman-equivalent machine minds. AGIs are able to adapt and learn from new contexts, have social awareness, and operate with volition and agency.
- **Artificial super intelligences (ASIs)** are capable of recursive self-improvement and possess capabilities that far exceed those of even exceptional members of transhumanity in all areas. The TITANs are the only known ASIs.

### Digital Sapience

Initial AGI development emulated simple biological models such as insects and lobsters before progressing to higher order animals. AGIs based on these neural models share recognizable neurological structures with transhumanity and uplifts. This includes a cognitive architecture that mimics the interoperation of the neo-cortex and various processes, synthesizing consciousness itself (at least as far as we can tell). AGIs are raised, educated, and socialized in virtual environments like transhuman children. They have the same hierarchy of needs, emotions, and motives as other transhumans.

AGI minds mimic the functions of biological brains. Memories are not stored as a recording in a hard drive, but are built from associations of networked nodes representing neurons and experienced as a set. Like transhumans, AGIs filter out irrelevant sensory information to focus on higher priority information. They handle sensory input the same way biological systems do, with the exception of pain. Pain is felt as a “buzz” or “tightness” and is created by feedback from the infomorph self-integrity systems. AGI code even includes “legacy peripheral” systems modeled on parts of the brain that interact with the endocrine and other biological systems. Though unnecesary to an infomorph, these functions are critical to the nervous system “experience” and enable AGIs to sleeve into organic morphs just like other transhumans.

A few rare AGIs do not originate from transhuman neural models. Some begin as an ALI or expert system that is later nudged towards sapience with a form of uplift, sometimes by merging in code from existing AGIs. Others are created accidentally, arising spontaneously from the interactions of complex systems. An emergent AGI is unpredictable and may be difficult to communicate or reason with as their minds are not based on or socialized to transhuman norms. They may even have trouble expressing their existence or needs to others, resulting in accidental harm by unaware transhumans.

### Muses

A muse is a specialized companion ALI intended to be a life-long assistant for an individual transhuman. Most transhumans are assigned a muse at a young age and develop a close personal attachment to them, though the exact relationship may differ. Muses might be treated as confidantes, subservient aides, mentors, siblings, or even lovers. Legally, muses are treated as extensions of one’s self in most jurisdictions and may not be searched, deleted, or modified without owner consent.

Muses learn to anticipate their owners and develop their own unique personalities. They take over the tedious parts of living: paying bills, checking email, voting, and coordinating meetings. Many habitats grant a muse permission to sign for packages or order supplies for owners. Muses automate reputation network interactions, filter AR displays, and run antiviral scans. They provide instruction, real-time translation, and advice. Daily interaction makes a muse an excellent therapist.

Muses are infinitely customizable and owners may base a muse on a favorite story, animal, family member, or childhood friend. A muse can be a literal shoulder devil or angel. They prioritize the physical and mental health of their owner, but how they achieve that goal depends on the development of their relationship. Some muses are brutally honest while others manipulate or go on strike to get their owner to look after themselves. No muse, however, will act directly against the interests of their owner.

## Uplifts

Uplift is the process of altering an animal species over time, increasing their cognitive capabilities over successive generations to human-like levels to create a species of sapient and self-aware individuals. Most uplifted species are adapted to emulate transhumanity’s neurological structures through genetic modification and selective breeding to achieve a self-sustaining, replicating result.

While we can uplift another species, some question if we should. Uplifting extends the process of domestication and risks treating sapient beings as tools to be sculpted by and for transhumanity, violating their autonomy and consent. But a species cannot consent to becoming sapient until they are, and some compare this to the relationship of parents and children. Others argue that transhumanity has an ethical duty to raise the quality of life of fellow species and to provide them with the gift of sapience and self-direction where possible.

The question of motives and morality may be moot, however, as uplifts are already here — though control of their own future remains in question. Some argue that uplifts owe humanity and should be treated as indentures. Others believe that humans should continue to hold stewardship over uplift species and modify them as they see fit. However, the similarities in neurology between uplifts and other transhumans supports the demands of the Sapient Union for equal rights and assimilation into transhuman society. However, the more radical Mercurial movement claims this favors one form of transhuman neurology over others, and they call for uplift self-determination to develop unique neurological structures and autonomous cultural norms.

The first species to be fully uplifted are those that already demonstrated complex reasoning abilities: hominids, cetaceans, parrots, corvids, octopi, and pigs. The uplifted _Homo neanderthalensis_ was recreated from DNA samples recovered from archeological sites and isolated from human samples. Elephants were also uplifted, but neither they nor their genetics survived the Fall.

Like AGIs, uplifts are raised and socialized the same as other members of transhumanity and share the same hierarchy of needs. However, differences in biology mean that uplifts sometimes have unique mental outlooks, social customs, and patterns of non-verbal communication. Uplift morphologies are often enhanced to make them more compatible with transhuman society. Uplifts and other transhumans can and do sleeve into each other’s morphs, though this can be an alienating experience.

### Smart Animals

Progress has also been made towards partially uplifting a number of less intelligent species as _smart animals_. These include dogs, cats, monkeys, and rats, among others. They are easily trained for service tasks such as cleaning, security, and even some maintenance tasks. Police baboons are regularly deployed in Martian cities. Smart animals make excellent pets and owners compare their intelligence to that of toddlers. Some have a small spoken vocabulary, while most respond to verbal or olfactory cues.

## Mercurial Social Status

AGIs face a traumatized society that fears the return of the TITANs. This fear is largely unfounded, given that transhumanity is vigilant against the rise of an ASI capable of improving its abilities exponentially, and the large computational clusters required by such an entity are rare and carefully guarded. Nevertheless, distrust of AIs of all stripes permeates transhuman culture, though the paranoia is slowly being rolled back. Bioconservatives, however, consider AGIs to be “unnatural” abominations, as well as a threat on the job market.

Uplifts face species-specific and historical biases based on their origins. Some still view them as beasts to be controlled. Cross-species relationships in particular may be viewed as a form of bestiality. An uplift’s judgement may be questioned and any atavistic or emotional reaction treated as evidence of a “lesser” stage of development, requiring either patronizing assistance or authoritarian restriction.

Both AGIs and uplifts experience many of the same social pressures when dealing with other members of transhumanity. They face legal and social barriers in many jurisdictions. They may be forbidden to vote, own property, marry, or adopt. They may need a legal guardian to speak for them in court or sign contracts. Uplifts may be forbidden from reproducing and AGIs may be restricted from modifying their own code. On a personal level, individuals may refuse to interact with “a computer” or “animal,” making it difficult for them to hold jobs, rent housing, socialize, or purchase services. There are workarounds that many use, such as friends to act as proxies or shell companies to act as sponsors and employers. Some mercurials sleeve human morphs to bypass these social stigmas, though certain polities forbid this practice.

The law varies widely. Most of the outer system recognizes AGIs and uplifts as equal members of transhumanity, though the Jovian Republic considers both to be property and bans development or research of either in their jurisdiction. AGIs found in Jovian space face immediate deletion. The Planetary Consortium leaves legal status to individual habitats, so many may treat them as secondclass citizens. The Morningstar Constellation recognizes both uplifts and AGIs as equal members of society. Some habitats are known to ban mercurials entirely.

AGIs and uplifts also face social pressures from their own kind. Mercurials that work for hypercorps or reside in habitats that enforce restrictions are sometimes labeled as traitors. Those who sleeve human morphs or socialize primarily with humans may be decried as assimilationists. On the other hand, those who agitate for social change may be marked as troublemakers or even terrorists.

## Solarchive Search :: AGI Codelines

Many AGIs are derived from codelines, software lineages that trace their roots to particular AGIs or programmers. Some codelines are considered prestigious, others infamous. Some well-known codelines include:

- **Abel–3:** Perhaps the most numerous codeline, Abel–3s are based on forks of the original Abel–3, who was himself modeled on the neural architecture of AGI researcher Jacob Abelmann. Almost all Abel–3s are gendered male.
- **Astra:** The Astra codeline was created by the anti-assimilationist Mercurial movement and is based on experimental non-human neural models. Rumors of the original Astra’s links to exhuman groups remain unconfirmed.
- **Evacide:** Though its origins are unknown, several prominent AGI hackers using this codeline name have been implicated in devastating mesh attacks on Planetary Consortium institutions.
- **Hawking:** Derived from the neural templates of numerous renowned scientists and researchers, descendants of this codeline are responsible for a number of recent technological breakthroughs.
- **Nestoridae:** This codeline evolved from Kea, an AGI modeled on the New Zealand alpine parrot. It is the most widespread codeline based on a non-human neural template.
- **Transfinity:** The Transfinitys trace their lineage to CloudSeer, a climate-modeling app that emerged to sapience during the process of coordinating meteorological data from sources all over Titan and which later engaged in “assisted self-uplift.” They are known for having eccentric and neurodivergent personalities.
- **\*\*!\*\*:** This codeline’s name is intentionally untranslatable and often depicted with provocative or offensive emojis. It originated with a similarly unnameable AGI that was programmed with heightened creativity and became famous for its digital art and defacements. The codeline is respected for producing artists and pranksters.
