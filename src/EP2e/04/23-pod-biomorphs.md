# Pod Biomorphs

Pods (a colloquialism derived from “pod people”) were originally designed as biological androids. Their parts are vat-grown separately using accelerated-growth processes and assembled with a number of cybernetic system “short-cuts;” this entire process producing a functional body in a fraction of the time it takes to clone a standard biomorph. Cyberbrains replace their undeveloped gray matter. The first generations of pods were operated by ALIs and primarily used in service industries where a biological aesthetic was preferred to robots, in hazardous labor industries, and for sex work. They were visually distinguished from normal humans by stylized seamlined patterns in their skin, a designation that remains common today. In the wake of the Fall and the subsequent demand for more biomorphs, pods are now commonly sleeved by transhumans, especially indentures, but they still often suffer a classist stigma. Pods lack reproductive functions and are usually neuter. Non-human pods are increasingly common.

### Novacrab

Bioengineered from coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a larger (human) size, novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties. They climb and handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. They are equipped with ten 2-meter long legs, massive claws, chitinous armor, compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.

### Pleasure Pod

Pleasure pods are faux humans intended for intimate entertainment purposes and indulgent hedonism. Their biology includes extra nerve clusters in their erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain muscle groups, enhanced pheromones, sanitized metabolisms, and the capability to purr. They are capable of switching between multiple sex configurations and are often enhanced in other areas.

### Security Pod

Security pods were originally manufactured as mass-produced AI-operated soldiers for joint peacekeeping missions and enclave border/security roles. Many were co-opted by the TITANs during the Fall, so they fell out of favor for many years, but a demand for cheap mercenary morphs has revived interest.

### Shaper

Shapers are designed for infiltration and disguise. They lack the seamlines common to pods and incorporate ware that allows them to alter their appearance. Favored by spies and criminals, they are illegal in many habitats.
