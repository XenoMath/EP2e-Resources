# Common Biomorphs

Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (often genetically modified and equipped with implants), birthed naturally or from an exowomb, and grown to adulthood either naturally or at a slightly accelerated rate.

<blockquote>

## Biomorphs with Cyberbrains

It is increasingly common to find biomorphs with cyberbrains, especially in the outer system. The advantage is that cyberbrains allow for easier resleeving and forking and have built-in mnemonic memory augmentations. The disadvantage is they are vulnerable to hacking. Adding a cyberbrain, access jacks, mnemonics, and puppet sock to your morph increases the MP cost by 1.

### Flat

Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies. Flats are increasingly rare outside bioconservative enclaves — most died off with the rest of humanity during the Fall.

### Exalt

Exalts are the common, non-specialized “enhanced human” model. They are genetically upgraded to make them healthier, smarter, and more attractive (based on ever-evolving beauty standards). A modified metabolism keeps them fit and athletic for the duration of an extended lifespan.

### Neotenic

Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a child-like form. They are smaller, more agile, inquisitive, and less resource-depleting, making them ideal for habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neotenic sleeves distasteful, especially when employed in certain media and sex work capacities, but most are designed to be neuter-gendered.

### Bouncer

Bouncers are genetically adapted for microgravity. Their legs are more limber and their feet can grasp as well as their hands. They can tolerate the cold temperatures of beehive tunnels and have an oxygen reserve in case they are exposed to vacuum. Bouncers are very common in the outer system and zero-g habitats.

### Futura

Futura morphs were specially crafted for the “Lost Generation” of accelerated-growth children. Adjusted for confidence, self-reliance, and adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity regain its foothold. These programs proved disastrous and the line was discontinued, but some models and various spin-offs remain, viewed by some with distaste and others as collectibles or exotic oddities.

### Hibernoid

Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with heavily altered sleep patterns and metabolic processes. Hibernoids have a decreased need for sleep, requiring only 1–2 hours a day on average. They can also trigger a form of voluntary hibernation, effectively halting their metabolism and need for oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration space travelers, but these morphs are also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists with non-stop lifestyles.

### Remade

The remade are completely redesigned: humans 2.0. Their cardiovascular system is stronger, their digestive tract sanitized and restructured, and they have been optimized for health, intelligence, and longevity with numerous transgenic mods.

They look close to human, but are different in very noticeable and sometimes eerie ways: taller, lack of hair, slightly larger craniums, wider eyes, smaller noses, smaller teeth, and elongated digits. The remade are popular with the Ultimates faction.
