# Step 3: Interest

What else does your character do? Did they have a previous career, a second career, or are they learning a new one? Do they pursue other interests as a hobby, out of curiosity or necessity? Is there an area of work they have specialized in?

Your interest provides you with a package of skills, just like your background and career.

This will be your final skills package, though you might purchase extra skills or tweak the ones you’ve already acquired in later steps.
