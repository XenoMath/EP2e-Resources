# Step 12: Starting Morph & Gear

Your character receives starting gear based on the career chosen in Step 2 and the type of campaign you are playing (Firewall, gatecrashing, or criminal). See [Gear Packs](27-gear-packs.md).

You also choose your character’s [starting morph](21-morphs.md). Each morph has a cost in Morph Points (MP). Your GM will tell how many points you have to work with. The suggested default value is 6&nbsp;MP. If you also purchased the [Resources trait](28-traits.md#resources), increase your available MP by that trait level.

You may also spend your Morph Points on [morph traits](28-traits.md#positive-morph-traits) or extra gear. Whatever MP you don’t spend is converted into Flex points instead.

## Starting Morphs

While it may be tempting to spend all of your MP to get the best morph available, we strongly suggest picking the morph that best fits your character. You will likely have opportunities to switch morphs during game. Morph Availability stats do not apply to morphs bought during character creation.

You may buy more than one morph, in case you want a fallback on hand or plan to do a lot of forking. In this case, you cannot purchase negative traits for _any_ of your morphs. Additionally, the first morph you buy must have an MP cost of 1 or more (not counting traits) and any morphs bought after the first with a listed 0&nbsp;MP cost 1&nbsp;MP instead.

Your morph will provide several stats: pools, Wound Threshold, Durability, and Death Rating. Note these on your character sheet. Also take note of any implants or traits it might have.

## Morph Traits

Positive traits have an MP cost listed. Negative traits _give_ you bonus MP. No more than 6&nbsp;MP worth of negative traits may be purchased.

## Extra Gear

You may use your MP for extra gear.

Minor complexity gear costs 1&nbsp;MP, Moderate 2&nbsp;MP, and Major 3&nbsp;MP.

## Flex Points

Morph Points that you don’t spend on morphs, traits, or gear are converted to Flex points instead, on a 2:1 basis (2&nbsp;MP = 1 Flex), up to a maximum of 3. These Flex points are temporary, they will be reset the next time you resleeve ([Acquiring Morphs](../15/03-acquiring-morphs.md)).
