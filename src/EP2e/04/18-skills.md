# Skills

Skills represent your character’s accumulated knowledge, education, and experience. They are the most important part of your ego, traveling with you from morph to morph. Having a well-rounded skill set is vital to survival in Eclipse Phase.

## Skills and Aptitudes

Your learned skills are built upon your inherent abilities, your core aptitudes. Each skill is linked to an aptitude and increased by that aptitude’s base value. Aptitudes range from 0 to 30, with a 15 representing an average transhuman. If an aptitude is modified, all linked skills are modified as well.

## Skill Categories

Skills are also assigned to a number of other categories, as noted on the [Skill List](19-active-skill-list.md#skill-list): Combat, Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle skills. Certain traits, abilities, and modifiers may only apply to skills of a specific category.

## Field Skills

When you choose a field skill, you must select a particular emphasis for that skill known as a _field_. Field skills are written as “\[Skill\]: \[Field\].” For example, when choosing Know skill, you must pick a particular discipline, such as Know: Engineering or Know: Biology. Field skills may be purchased more than once, with a different field chosen each time. Each field essentially serves as a separate skill. Suggested fields are listed for each field skill, but players and GMs can cooperate to create others.

## Specializations

You may opt to specialize in a given skill. Specializations represent a focus in one particular aspect of that skill. For example, Beam Weapons is a specialization of Guns skill. Specializations are written in parentheses after the skill name — e.g., Guns (Beam Weapons). Each skill lists a number of possible specializations, but players and GMs can generate their own. Field skills may also have specializations.

Specializations provide a +10 bonus when using that skill in a situation appropriate to the specialization.
