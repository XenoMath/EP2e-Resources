# Step 9: Reputation

You have 100 points to divide between rep networks. There are [seven networks](01-character-stats.md#rep) to choose from. You should strongly consider taking rep scores that fit your faction choice.

We recommend taking either 60/40 in two networks or 50/25/25 in three networks. You may not start with a rep score higher than 80 in any network.

If you are unsure what rep networks to choose, talk to your GM about leaving them blank for now and filling them in during gameplay.

**Spending CP:** Every point of CP buys you 5 rep points.
