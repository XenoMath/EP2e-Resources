# Step 4: Faction

Now that you have a rough orientation for your character’s background and skill sets, it’s time to pick a faction to which they hold allegiance. Each choice provides a [motivation](16-step-13-motivations.md) and a skill of Know: \[Faction\] 30. The Factions sidebar provides a brief summary of each group; further details can be found on [Factions](../10/00-factions.md).

If you are unsure of what faction to pick at this time, you may skip this section for now and determine your faction, motivation, and Know skill during gameplay. You also can choose not to have a faction — not everyone picks sides. If going factionless, simply choose your own motivation and take any Know skill you like at 30.

Faction allegiance does not necessarily mean you are a hardcore true believer. You may have been born or raised into a faction and reluctantly stuck with it, or you may be finding yourself questioning some of the faction’s tenets. You may be a dissident, trying to actively change the faction from within. For now, your faction allegiance indicates the transhuman grouping you are most familiar with and whose goals you at least nominally support. Perhaps you are even a defector or new recruit, with an Know skill in your old faction but a motivation tied to your new one.
