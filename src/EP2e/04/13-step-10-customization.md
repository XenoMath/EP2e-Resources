# Step 10: Customization

You receive 20 Customization Points (CP) you may spend on the following. **If you’re still figuring out your character, talk to your GM about saving some CP and buying things later on during gameplay.** Just keep track of what you’ve spent.

## Increased Aptitude

**\[1&nbsp;CP per point\]**

CP may be spent to increase aptitude scores at a cost of 1&nbsp;CP per aptitude point. This will increase all skills linked to that aptitude as well; no skill may be raised above 80. Increases to COG or INT may increase the number of languages you start with (see Step 7).

## Ego Traits

**\[Variable\]**

You may purchase any of the ego traits listed on [Traits](28-traits.md). Positive traits have a CP cost listed. Negative traits _give_ you bonus CP. No more than 6&nbsp;CP worth of negative traits may be purchased.

There are a lot of traits to choose from, so if you’re unfamiliar with them or don’t have the time to scan through them, skip this for now and save some CP to buy traits later. A summary of traits is on [Positive Traits](28-traits.md#positive-traits) and [Negative Traits](28-traits.md#negative-traits).

If you took the Lost background in Step 1 or the Async interest in Step 3, you _must_ purchase the Psi trait.

## Increased Flex

**\[2&nbsp;CP per point\]**

CP may be spent to increase your Flex pool at a cost of 2&nbsp;CP per 1 Flex. Your ego Flex points may not be raised higher than 3 (not counting Flex derived from your morph).

## Extra Languages

**\[1&nbsp;CP per language\]**

Extra languages may be learned at a cost of 1&nbsp;CP per 1 language.

## Extra Rep

**\[1&nbsp;CP per 5 points\]**

CP may be spent for extra Rep points. 1&nbsp;CP = 5 points to be spent on rep. No rep score may be raised higher than 80.

## Extra Skills

**\[1&nbsp;CP per 5 points\]**

CP may be spent for extra skill points. 1&nbsp;CP = 5 skill points. No skill may be raised higher than 80 during character creation.

## Psi Sleights

**\[1&nbsp;CP per sleight\]**

If you purchased the Psi trait, you will likely want to spend CP on sleights, or [psi powers](../14/06-psi-sleight-summaries.md). Note that you get one starting sleight for free, based on your [sub-strain](../14/02-watts-macleod-sub-strains.md).

Psi sleights cost 1&nbsp;CP per sleight. You may only purchase psi-gamma sleights if you have the Psi trait at Level 2. The maximum number of sleights you may purchase during character creation is 10.

## Specializations

**\[1&nbsp;CP per specialization\]**

Skill specializations cost 1&nbsp;CP. They give a +10 bonus to that skill when that specialization applies. (This specialization bonus does not count towards the skill maximum of 80.)
