Use Interface to manipulate electronics, command software, forge video files, scan for wireless devices, jam frequencies, get sensor readings, control life support functions, and understand new devices. Interface is also used to attack with non-portable weapon emplacements and the weapon systems of piloted (but not jammed or sleeved) vehicles and spacecraft ([Weapon Systems](../12/08-weapon-systems.md)).

Though synthmorphs are designed to emote, reading them is more difficult; apply a −30 modifier. The same modifier also applies to ALIs that are operating pods, bots, or synthmorphs. At the GM’s discretion, similar modifiers may apply to morphs that lack anthropomorphic characteristics or that are sleeved by egos accustomed to much different physiologies (such as a neo-octopi in a neo-avian morph).
