# Character Creation Advice

A few words of wisdom before you get started.

## Create as a Group

It’s best to have a balanced selection of character types, so you can better overcome obstacles and dangers. Work with the other players to make sure you have the basics covered. There are four archetypes every Eclipse Phase team can use: combat, face (social), hacker, and scientist. Within those archetypes there are many variations and it can be worthwhile to overlap, in case one PC is removed from the action.

## Plan Ahead

Character creation is a step-by-step process, with the exception of Customization Points (CP). Everyone gets 20&nbsp;CP (possibly more, if you also buy negative traits) to spend in Step 10, and you can use some or all of these points to increase stats acquired in previous steps. To minimize the need to recalculate anything, try to keep your CP spending options in mind during each step. If you’re not quite able to get what you want, that’s probably a good time to spend CP.

## Playing an Async

If you’re looking to make a psychic character, familiarize yourself with the rules for [psi](../14/00-psi.md). You should strongly consider the [Lost](04-step-1-background.md#lost) and/or [Async](06-step-3-interest.md#async) skill packages, which will give you Psi skill. You will need to purchase the [Psi trait](28-traits.md#psi) with your Customization Points, and some other traits may also be of interest. You should also set aside some of your CP to spend on [psi sleights](../14/06-psi-sleight-summaries.md). The [sub-strain](../14/02-watts-macleod-sub-strains.md) you choose will characterize your infection and also provide you with options for the mandatory Addiction or Mental Disorder trait you must take and the free sleight you get. Finally, be sure to calculate your Infection Rating in [Step 11: Derived Stats](14-step-11-derived-stats.md).
