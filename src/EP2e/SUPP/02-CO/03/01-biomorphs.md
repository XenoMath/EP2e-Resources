## Alpiner

![Alpiner](PNG/alpiner.png)

Alpiners were common in the early days of the Martian frontier, when temperatures and atmospheric pressure had not yet risen to present levels. Now they are favored by avid rock climbers, those living at high altitudes atop Mars’s shield volcanoes, and outdoor types who must endure more harsh and rugged conditions. Alpiners are also vogue among chic urbanites going for a rough-and-ready look without sleeving the more de classe ruster morph.

| **Voight-Kampff:** There’s a statistical anomaly in that an unusually high percentage of alpiners go missing in the Martian outback.                                           |
| **Skinwalker:** Sounds like a biased-sample fallacy; alpiner-clad folks are more likely to engage in risky behavior like mountaineering, rock climbing, and hiking, after all. |
| **Voight-Kampff:** Take a look at the areopositioning distribution of the missing alpiners, I think you’ll find it interesting.                                                |

## Aquanaut

![Aquanaut](PNG/aquanaut.png)

Aquanauts are environmentally adapted for underwater activities while still functional on land. Their heart rate slows while submerged, their skin includes a layer of blubber that retains heat, they store oxygen in their muscle tissue, and they do not suffer negative health effects from pressure changes. Additionally, their eyes have nictitating membranes and their corneas adjust to counter underwater refraction. Their hands and feet are webbed and they possess a transgenic swim bladder for controlling buoyancy. They can safely descend to about 200 meters depth (roughly 21 atmospheres of pressure at 1 g); deeper requires the pressure adaptation mod.

| **Skinwalker:** The base models don’t have the depth range of a selkie or synth, but aquanauts are great whenever you need to function both underwater and on land. It takes some time acclimating to the transition from water- to air-breathing and vice-versa, though.              |
| **Plasmid:** A small hypercorp called ParaLife has made some interesting progress with an aquanaut strain that is completely amphibian: ectothermic, can breathe through their skin, and so on. Drawback is that they’re slimy: specialized glands keep their skin moist out of water. |

## Ariel

![Ariel](PNG/ariel.png)

The surprising number of transhumans who sleeve in Titan-adapted hulder morphs encouraged designers on Profunda to develop a Titan-adapted flyer. While the sturdy hulder morph is designed for nomadic herders, the ariel morph is designed by people who wish to survive by hunting. Individuals sleeved in the ariel morph can hunt and eat Titanian caribou, but they most often eat the smaller rabbitlike creatures that Profunda designers have also recently designed to live on Titan. Ariel morphs have exotic-looking heads similar to those of hulder morphs, but they also possess sleek and streamlined humanoid bodies with four limbs and a pair of bat-like wings. These morphs have also been used by a few daring transhumans to explore the upper cloud layers of both Saturn and Uranus.

| **Scent.In.Hell:** Here’s your Extreme Camping Morph, or at least the Flying Carnivore variant model. Who the Hell gets wet about roughing it on Titan, anyway?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Psychscaper:** Some people want to experience everything, or maybe they want to feel like they’ve conquered anything nature can throw at them?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Sava:** Yeah, I know some exhumans that talk that way. I told ‘em to call me when they conquer the surface of the sun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Skinwalker:** While this was one of the weirder sleeving experiences I’ve had, it was certainly interesting. Flying through Titan’s methane clouds, living in the hydrocarbon wilds … it wasn’t right, but the morph felt so smooth that it wasn’t wrong either. Tearing hunks out of cryorabbits to survive actually just felt appropriate. Those Profundan genehackers know what they’re doing. |

## Bouncer

![Bouncer](PNG/bouncer.png)

Bouncers are genetically adapted for microgravity. Their legs are more limber and their feet can grasp as well as their hands. They can tolerate the cold temperatures of beehive tunnels and have an oxygen reserve in case they are exposed to vacuum. Bouncers are very common in the outer system and zero-g habitats.

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sequencer:** Bouncers are one of the more common sleeves out there, especially in the outer system. That means there’s more variants and models than you can kick a moon rock at. My favorites are the ones with tails — that extra grip comes in handy in micrograv. |
| **Plasmid:** If you’re picking up a bouncer, make sure to get one of the genetic lines that incorporated the 3D spatial awareness traits from cetacean neurologies; it really helps you orient and maneuver better.                                                     |
| **Voight-Kampff:** How useless are these in higher grav?                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Skinwalker:** The foot structure impedes your running, but only slightly. On long treks, expect a lot of cramping and blisters.                                                                                                                                       |

## Bruiser

![Bruiser](PNG/bruiser.png)

This morph is made to be large, strong, and physically intimidating. Adopted early on by sports performers, it quickly became a favorite among criminal cartels and thugs. At 2.5 meters tall, a bruiser may have difficulty moving comfortably in all but the most open and uncrowded of habitats.

## Cloud Skate

![Cloud Skate](PNG/cloud-skate.png)

Cloud skates are exotic, specialized biomorph designs that push the edge of what is possible. They are designed to survive in the atmospheres of ice giants and gas giants, such as Uranus and Saturn. These morphs are shaped roughly like a tailless stingray with a pair of slender arms. They can soar among the clouds for months on end, their swim bladders providing neutral buoyancy in dense atmospheres, preventing them from sinking below a safe depth.

| **Nova Vida:** Nope. The same group resleeved, went back, and disappeared again. Now it’s a thing, and Gatekeeper has applications for a handful of thrill-seekers that want to skate their way to doom as well. What are the odds that at least one of those groups are sentinels? Sounds like it might be an interesting time. |
| **Ruqinzhe:** Hobnobbing with death-wish socialites while trying not to die? Not so interesting to me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Crasher

![Crasher](PNG/crasher.png)

Crashers are survival morphs — athletic and rugged designs capable of weathering harsh environments over long periods. They are the ideal biomorph for gatecrashing assignments and are popular among first-in teams. Though pricey and harder to acquire compared to other options, gatecrashers traveling to less habitable and dangerous places have found the investment worth it.

| **Sequencer:** Just be careful what brand name you pick. I know for a fact that certain hypercorps cut corners on the genetics in order to rush out morphs to meet the demand for gatecrashing missions. I’ve seen reports of respiratory failure in atmos well within their safety range and hibernators falling into nonresponsive comas. Skins from Omniflesh have particularly bad reviews. |

## Dvergr

![Dvergr](PNG/dvergr.png)

Dvergar (plural of dvergr) are biomorphs designed for comfortable operation in high-gravity environments. They feature a reinforced skeletal structure and sturdier muscle masses. They are easily identified by their slightly squat, thick-necked, tough appearances.

| **Astika:** Definitely a specialty morph. Very limited application, but you’ll be really happy you have it when you need it. Gravity is a drag. |
| **Ammonite:** Also great if you’re a socialite on a LARP cruise and decide to play a dwarf. Or so I hear.                                       |
| **Skinwalker:** Dvergr are just fine in normal, low, or micro grav. Strong, energetic, great circulation.                                       |
| **Scent.In.Hell:** Maybe too good. I’ve heard some models bleed out quickly when injured in low-grav conditions.                                |

## Exalt

![Exalt](PNG/exalt.png)

Exalts are the common, non-specialized “enhanced human” model. They are genetically upgraded to make them healthier, smarter, and more attractive (based on ever-evolving beauty standards). A modified metabolism keeps them fit and athletic for the duration of an extended lifespan.

| **Nezumi:** The great thing about exalts is that they’re reliable, abundant, and fulfill your basic needs without running into heavy alienation or body dysmorphia issues when resleeving. Too many people overlook them. |

## Faust

![Faust](PNG/faust.png)

Developed in secret by a small group of unaffiliated async genehackers, this morph is not a publicly known model. It is only available to individuals who discover a connection to this unnamed, underground async network and then download the template from one of several secret mesh sites. The faust is a modified menton morph. Even under the most thorough scans, it appears to be nothing more than a mildly personalized version of that morph.

| **Plasmid:** There are implications here that concern me. If one can design and distribute a morph based on its compatibility with an exovirus strain, we may well soon see morphs that are compatible — read: more susceptible — to less friendly strains. |
| **Scent.In.Hell:** Watch what you call “friendly.” Not all of us buy into the harmlessness of Watts- MacLeod. The decision to let asyncs operate freely is going to bite us in the hind thorax down the line, mark my words.                                |

## Flat

![Flat](PNG/flat.png)

Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies. Flats are increasingly rare outside bioconservative enclaves — most died off with the rest of humanity during the Fall.

| **Dante:** Actually, there’s a decent demand from people that want to sleeve something “old-fashioned’ and “original.” I’m pretty sure it started as a Venusian socialite fad.                                                                                                       |
| **Nezumi:** *facepalm* The only sensible part of that is that flats are actually pretty rare outside of Earth orbit, Luna, and the Jovian Republic.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Ammonite:** It gets weirder. I know oligarchs that collect flats. Original, born-on-Earth skins are quickly becoming collector items — especially if they are in mint condition. Interestingly, nonrejuvenated bodies that have aged well are picking up a considerable price tag. |
| **Nova Vida:** I’ve always wondered what happened to older flats. I assumed they were rejuvenated rather than retired, but even then I didn’t expect them to be top hits at the body bank.                                                                                           |
| **Plasmid:** The body banks I know keep a few on hand as out-of-stock last-resort options; there’s always someone who’d rather take a flat than a quality synth. The flats with recurring health problems go at cheap rates to desperate infugees.                                   |

## Freeman

![Freeman](PNG/freeman.png)

This sleeve hands tyrants the tools to ensure loyalty — or at least obedience — from their citizens. Based on simple splicers, freeman morphs are genetically and psychosurgically modified to be receptive to authority while weakening willpower and “dissident” traits. They are also genetically modified with a protein that makes their neurons sensitive to light. When combined with an optogenetics module, these neurons can be activated and deactivated remotely, enabling a monitoring muse or meshed overseer to control the ego’s behavior. Freeman morphs typically carry a monitor ALI (often a modified fork of the dictator’s muse) that watches over the ego, reports suspicious activity, and can seize physical control in an emergency. In some regimes, citizens are not informed of these implants, enabling the AIs to spy and snitch in secret. These “slave morphs” are decried or outlawed as coercive in many polities, though they are secretly deployed in remote corporate and authoritarian habitats. Surprisingly, some people voluntarily sleeve freeman morphs, preferring to hand responsibility and decision-making over to other parties, such as the Sendero Luminoso Benevolent Dictatorship habitat in the Neptunian Trojans.

## Fury

![Fury](PNG/fury.png)

Furies are combat morphs. These transgenic humans are upgraded for endurance, strength, reflexes, and capacity to handle physical trauma. Behavioral modifications for aggressiveness are offset by gene sequences promoting pack mentalities and cooperation, and they tend to be biologically female.

## Futura

![Futura](PNG/futura.png)

Futura morphs were specially crafted for the “Lost Generation” of accelerated-growth children. Adjusted for confidence, self-reliance, and adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity regain its foothold. These programs proved disastrous and the line was discontinued, but some models and various spin-offs remain, viewed by some with distaste and others as collectibles or exotic oddities.

| **Cacophonous:** There’s a lot of people that believe futura morphs remain in circulation so that they can be tracked — reasoning being that they hope to catch fugitives from the Lost Generation that are still on the loose. |

| **Black Pharaoh:** I can substantiate one of those rumors. There is at least one Firewall scanner tasked with tracking futura morphs in the wild. It is wise to assume others do as well.                                       |

## Garuda

![Garuda](PNG/garuda.png)

Found primarily on Luna and similar low-g worlds and habitats, this morph is adapted to fly in Earth-normal air pressure with gravity of 0.2 g or less. Garudas have light frames, with increased lung capacity. Their feathered wings extrude from the back as an extra set of limbs, leaving hands and feet unhindered during flight. Their wings may be folded behind their back or extended to a full wingspan of 3 meters.

| **Ruqinzhe:** Last time I sleeved a ghost, I got a lesson in how less reputable skin joints try to screw you. I reserved in advance, paid up front, and went with a shady body bank to keep my profile low. After sleeving what I thought was a ghost, I had a nasty shock when I was jumped by some punks and the morph didn’t perform as expected. I had a genehacker I know run some scans, turns out I had been given a splicer with aftermarket mods. I took it back to the clinic, where the customer service AI politely told me to fuck off. Turns out that my muse had dropped the ball and contractually I’d agreed to a morph with certain parameters; the morph met those parameters (barely), and they called this special package a “ghost.” It apologized for any confusion but would not offer a refund. Fucking Extropian contracts. |

## Glider

![Glider](PNG/glider.png)

Gliders are tall and thin, with long, strong limbs and a lightweight build. Gliding membranes allow them to soar through the atmosphere in environments with thicker atmospheres and/or lower gravity. They gain altitude by riding thermals (which they see with enhanced vision).

## Grey

![Grey](PNG/grey.png)

Originally created as part of a fad based on 20th-century images of aliens, the grey morph soon became popular with eccentric scientists and engineers. This morph’s slender and weak-looking body stands only 1.5 meters tall, short compared to modern transhumans. Its distinctive large head and eyes strike many transhumans as disturbing.

## Hazer

![Hazer](PNG/hazer.png)

Hazers are tall but slight morphs adapted for life in Titan’s dome colonies. They cannot survive unprotected in Titan’s frigid methane environment, but they are insulated to handle a bit of cold. Some hazers have angular or elfin features that are viewed as either striking or unsettling.

| **Qi:** There was an incident with the main microcorp that produces hazers for the Commonwealth. Rumor is they euthanized a whole generation of forced-growth clones and shut down production for two months. Whatever happened, they’re keeping a tight lid on it. |

## Hibernoid

![Hibernoid](PNG/hibernoid.png)

Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with heavily altered sleep patterns and metabolic processes. Hibernoids have a decreased need for sleep, requiring only 1–2 hours a day on average. They can also trigger a form of voluntary hibernation, effectively halting their metabolism and need for oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration space travelers, but these morphs are also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists with non-stop lifestyles.

| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delta-V:** True fact, my original body was hibernoid. My parents were both flight crew in the early space days, and some of the first to be given hibernoids for their jobs. They liked their morphs so much they purchased breeding rights from their corp. I don’t think they really considered the ramifications of a kid that would sleep only a few hours at a time for weeks, then crash for a week straight. |
| **Callosum:** I imagine that impacted your sleeping rhythms later in life?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Delta-V:** The first time I sleeved a morph without the circadian hacks, I thought it was defective. I still can’t believe it’s normal for people to sleep that much on a daily basis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Hulder

![Hulder](PNG/hulder.png)

Hulder are engineered for survival in the harsh Titanian wilds and methane seas. In silhouette, their bodies resemble a longlegged great auk, though viewed up close, the resemblance to a bird ends.

## Hyperbright

![Hyperbright](PNG/hyperbright.png)

A research team on Bright created this morph to surpass the menton and push the envelope on intelligence augmentation. Hyperbrights are instantly recognizable by the brightly colored bony crests along their skulls that help to cool their brains. They are also designed for microgravity and so favored in the outer system. Many models, however, are plagued with idiosyncrasies and quirks due their advanced neurochemistry and high metabolism.

## Imp

![Imp](PNG/imp.png)

Shortly after the Fall, the refugees from Earth who would evolve into the scum faction struggled for resources under cramped conditions. Partying and letting off steam became an essential element of their survival. To complement this lifestyle, scum genehackers crafted morphs with the endurance to handle ragers with copious amounts of sex and drugs. These models became popular across the Solar System, particularly with “party tourists” looking to egocast into a new habitat, go on a week-long bender, and then beam back out.

## Neotenic

![Neotenic](PNG/neotenic.png)

Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a child-like form. They are smaller, more agile, inquisitive, and less resource-depleting, making them ideal for habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neotenic sleeves distasteful, especially when employed in certain media and sex work capacities, but most are designed to be neuter-gendered.

## Nomad

![Nomad](PNG/nomad.png)

The nomad biomorph is optimized for operating in desert environments. They incorporate many transgenic traits from camels: thicker eyelashes to keep out sand, a third eyelid to dislodge grit, a complex of arteries and veins for better brain cooling, elongated noses to trap exhaled water vapor, and sometimes hooves. They carry a distributed network of fat tissue that can be relocated around their body to adapt to high or low temperatures. This tissue can be rapidly metabolized for energy and water, allowing them to survive for 1–2 months without food or water.

| **mAlice:** The morph of choice for inner-system athlete wanna-bes and for the rich and connected seeking discreet muscle that still looks good. You go to any upscale vacation spot and the place is crawling with these morphs. A lot of the yahoos who sleeve olympians think they’re much stronger than they are and pull a muscle or rip a tendon.                                                                                    |

## Remade

![Remade](PNG/remade.png)

The remade are completely redesigned: humans 2.0. Their cardiovascular system is stronger, their digestive tract sanitized and restructured, and they have been optimized for health, intelligence, and longevity with numerous transgenic mods. They look close to human, but are different in very noticeable and sometimes eerie ways: taller, lack of hair, slightly larger craniums, wider eyes, smaller noses, smaller teeth, and elongated digits. The remade are popular with the Ultimates faction.

| **Scent.In.Hell:** The remade models available on the open market are not the ones currently used by high-ranking Ultimates. Those top dogs use models that are two or three generations ahead of those put into distribution. Those state-of-the-art designs almost never leave the main Ultimate habs, like Xiphos. On certain deployments where the entire group is Ultimates, you may see the next model that is likely to hit the market in a few months, which helps hype the expectations. |
| **Sequencer:** The remade models released by other manufacturers are generally equivalent quality to the current Ultimate stock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Designed for soaring along the rings of Saturn, this exotic spacefaring biomorph is also found skating the magnetic fields of other gas giant, ice giant, and asteroid systems. Easily recognizable with its slender limbs and the round hump of the plasma sail on its back, this morph can survive indefinitely in space, acquiring oxygen, water, and trace organic materials from ring particles, asteroids, and small moons as needed.

| **Rivet:** A morph only a hypercorp exec could love. The flaws of the ruster are numerous and well documented, but it does do what it’s advertised to do. Could it do it better? Sure, but there’s less profit margin in better. It’s not as though there’s a booming market of Marsacclimated competitor morphs, and while there’s certainly no shortage of synths, most settlers have trouble giving up the flesh. |
| **Plasmid:** The obsolescence built into many of these is easily circumvented by a good genehacker. Lots of Barsoomians out in the sticks have been running around in rusters for four or five years with only standard medical check-ins. Of course, modifying the morph voids the contract, so make sure you’re on good terms with someone who can do an occasional sleeve checkup.                                |

## Salamander

![Salamander](PNG/salamander.png)

Bio-engineered to survive in the semi-protected vacuum of coronal habitats, salamanders are popular with Solarians who need to adopt a humanoid form. Their skin is thick and hairless, their eyes reflective, with an overall look that is part reptilian, part monkey, and part fey. They lack noses and mouths, communicating wirelessly or via chromatophore patterning.

## Selkie

![Selkie](PNG/selkie.png)

Selkies are similar to aquanauts with heavy splices of seal traits. Their legs are fused into a pair of hind flippers for powerful swimming. On land, they can stand but have difficulty moving, as they must flop, roll, or hop like a seal, but they are sometimes sleeved in micrograv habs. They are adapted for the lack of air, deep cold, and crushing pressure of subcrustal oceans.

## Surya

![Surya](PNG/surya.png)

Despite the extreme temperatures of the solar corona, the plasma in that part of the sun’s atmosphere is incredibly diffuse, meaning actual heat transfer is quite low, making it survivable with the right protections. Suryas blur the line between biomorph and synthmorph and push the envelope of synthetic biology in order to survive in this hostile environment. Named for a Hindu sun deity, suryas reach lengths of ten meters or more and rely heavily on both whale and extremophile genetics. Their skin is a metamaterial that provides an almost perfect reflection of the sun’s spectral output and enables radiative cooling. They “surf ” the solar winds using powerful magnetic fields that also shield from radiation, plasma, and heat. Strong bones and connective tissues protect against the crushing solar gravity while medichines repair tissue damaged by radiation and convert hydrogen ions into water. Surya rely on lasers and chromatophore signaling using wavelengths not flooded by the sun’s emissions to communicate.

A lateral line organ allows them to “hear” the low-frequency vibrations that resonate through the corona’s plasma, which is both useful for limited “whale song” short-range communication and helpful for predicting and avoiding flares and other solar weather.

| **Cymascopist:** Surya tend to stick together in pods, but that’s not just because of the neo-cetacean cultural influence among the Solarians. They actually group together for more efficient cooling, using their magnetic fields to eject heated plasma and create a refrigerating low-pressure zone around the pod. |

### Nishakara Variant

Nishakara, named after the Hindu “night maker” lunar deity who sprang from the sea, are the generic non-coronal “space whale” variants of surya. Similar to ring flyers, they soar the solar winds and electromagnetic fields of large planetary systems.

## Sylph

![Sylph](PNG/sylph.png)

Sylph morphs are ideal for media icons, elite socialites, XP stars, models, and narcissists. Sylph gene sequences are tailored for distinctive good looks, ethereal and elfin features, and slim and lithe bodies. Their metabolism has also been sanitized to eliminate unpleasant bodily odors and their pheromones adjusted for universal appeal.

| **Cacophonous:** In autonomist circles, sylphs were considered superficial and egotistical at first. Those attitudes have mostly passed, but you still find them in some places.                                               |
| **Ammonite:** There’s plenty of sylph stigma in socialite circles, of all places. It’s the sort of morph the clueless and uncultured sleeve into for society functions, not realizing that off-the-rack is still off-the-rack. |
| **Lovelace:** It’s a good thing we’ve evolved as a species past such classist notions of taste.                                                                                                                                |

## Theseus
