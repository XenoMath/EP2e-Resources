## Arachnoid

![Arachnoid](PNG/arachnoid.png)

Arachnoid shells mimic the shapes of spiders, termites, ants, beetles, and other arthropods. Three or four sets of pneumatic limbs are capable of rotating around their meter-long torso, and an additional set of manipulator arms near the head enables fine manipulation and tool use. Arachnoids move by walking, hopping, extending omnidirectional mini-wheels for skating movement, or by retracting their limbs and maneuvering with vectored-air thrusters in microgravity.

| **Rivet:** Forget the thrusters. These morphs climb and jump surprisingly well. The wheels are omnidirectional and can even angle to handle slopes or serious curves.                  |
| **Stitch:** There are a lot of arachnoid models out there imitating different arthropod forms: spiders, termites, ants, beetles, etc. You name it, someone’s done a chassis mod of it. |
| **Eludere:** I’ve seen more than a few of these modified with hidden compartments to carry contraband, swarmanoids, or even neotenics.                                                 |

### Arachnikoma Variant

Arachnikoma’s are vehicle-sized arachnoids, with a hinged-top capsule/compartment large enough to carry a medium-sized transhuman or cargo.

## Biocore

![Biocore](PNG/biocore.png)

The biocore is a synthmorph with a biological brain. This design is favored by those who wish to enjoy the advantages of sleeving in a synthmorph without the risk of brainhacking or who simply dislike the idea of using a cyberbrain. It is popular with asyncs, as they retain their psi abilities. Some models feature a stylized but transparent braincase, to show off the biocore’s main feature, but others appear to be ordinary synthmorphs from the outside; only a detailed physical examination can determine that it actually contains a living brain.

| **Ammonite:** Yes, I really want to be soulgazing into your grey matter over coffee. Thanks for that. It’s only marginally better than that scum “artist,” Vagface.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Rivet:** Coreporeal produces a few biocore shells that look just like common synths on the outside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Stitch:** It’s sometimes worth dragging along the old lobes if you’re worried someone’s aiming to root your headcase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Ruqinzhe:** Our team’s async tried this. She liked it — a bit too much. Said it made her feel “free,” like her mind was liberated to wander the cosmos. The episodes of her talking to herself went up a notch or three, and ever since she’s been infatuated with the idea of switching over to gatecrashing ops. I’m inclined to let her go. |

## Case

![Case](PNG/case.png)

Cases are mass-produced robotic shells, an affordable resleeving option for the poor, though of notoriously poor quality. They are available in many varieties to suit a client’s taste. Most case morphs are anthropomorphic, with a thin framework body standing just shorter than an average human.

| **Qi:** There’s a reason more and more infugees and indentures are preferring to stay virtual.                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Stitch:** Have you all seen the new case designs sponsored by the Autonomist Alliance? Better quality, not much more expensive. Most of the designs are open-sourced too. I know a few Barsoomian maker labs on Mars that are churning them out.          |
| **Red Rover:** They need to keep careful. Oversight has been clamping down on these lately, citing the usual copyright infringement bullshit. They burned out a maker base in Elysium just last night. Literally. Nothing but a flaming crater left behind. |

## Cetus

![Cetus](PNG/cetus.png)

Named after a mythological sea monster, the cetus was designed to operate in the extreme pressure and cold of deep seas as well as the atmospheric portion of habitats. It is a favored morph in the subcrustal oceans of Ceres and Europa.

## Cloud Skimmer

![Cloud Skimmer](PNG/cloud-skimmer.png)

This streamlined synthmorph is designed for exploring the atmospheres of gas giants, but its internal rocket also allows it to operate in vacuum. It can travel to and from a ship in orbit around a gas giant into the planet’s atmosphere on its own. The morph is a flattened oval that can extend up to four flexible arms. A series of gas sacs and turbofans allows it to maneuver as a microlight within atmosphere.

## Courier

![Courier](PNG/courier.png)

Couriers were made to soar between the many moons and habitats in the Saturnian system. They are shaped like a multi-armed chess piece, with a humanoid head and torso atop a conical metallic-hydrogen rocket. With an acceleration of up to 0.25 g, couriers can take off and land on all moons and other small bodies in the Solar System (though entering an atmosphere such as Titan’s requires heat shielding). Since propellant storage is limited, an integrated plasma sail provides alternative thrust.

| **Nezumi:** Ring flyer courier culture is pretty interesting. Despite spending so much time isolated and alone, they really watch out for each other. It’s a very tight-knit group, hard to penetrate.                  |
| **Delta-V:** I know someone who rode one of these from the Belt to Mars. Pointed himself in the right direction, burned half his fuel, and rode out the rest. For months. Good thing he got his nav calculations right. |
| **Ruqinzhe:** Sounds like a useful way to do a long-range stealth approach.                                                                                                                                             |

## Dragonfly

![Dragonfly](PNG/dragonfly.png)

The dragonfly takes the shape of a meter-long flexible shell with eight wings, four manipulator limbs, and a prehensile tail. Capable of near-silent flight in Earth gravity, dragonfly bots fare even better in microgravity. Their wings operate independently and can rotate, allowing for graceful maneuvering, hovering, and tight turns.

| **Rivet:** The wing design is an excellent example of biomimicry. Each wing can operate independently and rotate on its axis, meaning this morph is capable of hovering, sudden bursts of acceleration, hairpin turns at any speed, and so on. It takes some practice getting used to the full capabilities. |
| **Nevermore:** I’ve heard a few neo-avians talk about having difficulty coping with the different flight mechanics.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Fenrir

![Fenrir](PNG/fenrir.png)

Named for the monstrous wolf of Norse legend, the fenrir is one of the most imposing combat morphs ever developed, akin to a squat, quadrupedal tank. Manufactured for the armed forces of the Hyoden city-state on Callisto, black-market blueprints and copies have inevitably turned up elsewhere. Of special note is that the fenrir is designed to be operated by up to six egos simultaneously, each handling different weapon systems and operational functions in tandem.

## Flexbot

![Flexbot](PNG/flexbot.png)

Flexbots are modular and customizable, each composed of one or more modules that interlock in various shapes and configurations. Individual modules are specialized towards specific functions and also capable of transforming into a variety of shapes and mechanisms. They have 4 limbs in their default configurations. Independent modules are only the size of a large dog, but multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, construction, or robotics assembly. Flexbots can also incorporate any robot with Modular Design ware as modules.

All flexbot modules have the following stats, plus the stats for their module type (with the exception of conjurers, who use only their module stats):

<blockquote class="indent stat-list">

- **Ware:** Access Jacks, Cortical Stack, Cyberbrain, Lidar, Mesh Inserts, Mnemonics, Modular Design, Puppet Sock, Shape Adjusting

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stitch:** Before you go crazy ordering different modules, be warned that different manufacturers don’t always play well together. Each flexbot manufacturer wants you to use their modules only, so they quite often incorporate proprietary design elements that mean they won’t work so great — or at all — with modules of another make, including any you nanofab yourself. So, read the fine print and the reviews. |
| **Pivo:** Annoying, yes, but not a deal breaker. Just make sure you or someone on your team knows a little robotics and programming and you should be fine. Of course, you’ll void the warranty, but when it’s a choice between a warranty and my life, my life wins every time.                                                                                                                                           |

## Griefer

![Griefer](PNG/griefer.png)

Griefers are disposable morphs used by trolls, vandals, and terrorists to spread chaos, harass people, antagonize the authorities, and worse. Griefers have embedded sound and holographic display systems to make their presence known. They are often equipped with hacking tools and other subversive ware, from graffiti implements and mounted sprayers to nanoswarm hives or even explosives, according to their specific purpose. Most importantly, they are built without cortical stacks, so if they are destroyed, the ego cannot be interrogated through psychosurgery. Griefers are illegal in many habitats, especially in the Planetary Consortium, but DRM-free blueprints are easy to find in many darknets, thus making them a persistent annoyance across the Solar System. A few habitats have passed laws mandating that destroying a griefer is not considered murder, assault, or even destruction of property.

| **Ammonite:** I am consistently amazed at the degree to which trolls will go. There’s an oligarch on Luna who pissed someone off either before or during the Fall. He has literally been stalked by griefers every day for the past decade. He’s given up trying to track the source, and his staff just destroy them on sight. |

## Guard

Guards are disguised with a synthetic mask to blend in with biomorphs, for those people uncomfortable with dragging around hulking synthmorphs as security personnel. At a casual glance, most will take them for olympians or furies. Their enhanced senses and built-in weaponry make them effective bodyguards.

| **Eludere:** Last op I was on, we had to arrange a private conversation with a triad boss. His three sylph companions turned out to be guards who put up a lot more of a fight than we expected. Our quiet snatch job turned into a shredded club and loads of collateral damage. Had to resleeve two of my team. Lesson learned: scan those bodyguards thoroughly next time. |
| **Pivo:** The trick to spotting a shell with a synthetic mask is to really take a look at the thermal signature. On a close analysis, you’ll find hot and cold spots that deviate from standard biomorph sigs. They did a pretty great job getting it right on these guard morphs, though it depends on the manufacturer and model.                                           |

## Kite

![Kite](PNG/kite.png)

Kites use their shape-adjusting composition primarily to configure into the optimal form for flight given local atmospheric conditions. Their default form is a turbofan-driven winged anthroform, light enough to fly and hover in thin atmospheres and heavy gravity. Other forms they can take include a compact and streamlined ionic mode (ideal for high speeds or maneuvering in hurricane-force winds), a butterfly- shape with extended wings (for gliding or tethered effortless station-keeping), or a winged shape to emulate local aerial life, among other options.

## Mimic

![Mimic](PNG/mimic.png)

With the ability to alter shape and appearance, a mimic can disguise itself as almost any small household object, such as a briefcase, cleaning robot, furnishing, or appliance. It can also fit through small spaces and hide itself with great ease, making it ideal for infiltration and sabotage missions. In its basic form, with its limbs retracted, this morph is a simple head-sized cube. With its limbs at full extension, it can stand up to two meters tall and reach two meters away.

| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stitch:** The drawback to mimicking things is that people sometimes expect you to be what you’re pretending to be. One time I was scouting an arms dealer’s warehouse and the guards came around, so I made like a small cargo container. Next thing I knew, I was loaded up in a pressurized vessel and on my way to the Main Belt. Wasn’t able to reconnect with my team for 6 months. |
| **Ruqinzhe:** That’s nothing. I made like a kitchen appliance once, but when I didn’t work like expected, I was tossed directly into the kitchen disassembler. Luckily the disassembler was smart enough to recognize and not take apart my stack, and my crew rescued me later.                                                                                                           |

## Nautiloid

![Nautiloid](PNG/nautiloid.png)

Nautiloids are a hybrid of short-range spacecraft and submersible capable of holding up to six passengers and their gear. The morph is shaped like a van-sized nautilus, with crew space in the head and shell. A cluster of tentacular limbs mounted under the observation ports in the head provide both fine and brute force manipulation. Originally created for comet and asteroid mining, the design also proved useful for oceanic exploration by gatecrashing teams and Europans.

A nautiloid’s life-support system can support its occupants for 1 week before replenishing — indefinitely if it has a source of hydrogen and oxygen.

## Oobleck

![Oobleck](PNG/oobleck.png)

Also known as gloops, ooblecks are shapechanging morphs consisting of reconfigurable components in a shear-thickening liquid matrix with a soft, flexible outer skin. Though they often take on a blob-like, amorphous state, they can transform themselves into all manner of shapes, including consolidating into more rigid forms. They can ooze through openings as small as 10 centimeters in diameter. Though their shape-changing options are more limited than flexbots, they can transform more quickly.

## Opteryx

| **Eludere:** A crew I know that makes quick runs into the TQZ for small packages uses these too. They like the size and ability to avoid detection by staying under radar range and dipping into crevices and caves to avoid satellite coverage.                                        |

### Blackbird Variant

When they’re seen at all, these synthmorphs resemble a matte gray neo-corvid with many odd, sharp angles. Blackbirds are consummate stealth morphs, designed to evade observation during recon or infiltration. In part due to aesthetics, they’re a favorite of neo-ravens.

## Q-Morph

![Q-Morph](PNG/q-morph.png)

Quartz morphs, commonly called Q-morphs, are the primary shell design used for Venusian surface mining. Constructed from quartz and extremely durable alloys, Q-morphs look like squat, four-legged crabs with two pairs of arms. The lower pair of arms is designed for strength, the upper pair for precision and dexterity. This morph is exceptionally tough and capable of handling Venus’s intense surface conditions. Behavioral mods help keep the workers sleeved in these morphs content with their grueling existence.

## Reaper

![Reaper](PNG/reaper.png)

The reaper is a combat morph in the form of an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a thin profile to an enemy. Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods are folded inside its frame. It uses vector-thrust nozzles to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advantage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance. Reapers are infamous due to military sims and Fall XPs; bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise eyebrows if not get you arrested.

## Rover

![Rover](PNG/rover.png)

Rover morphs are smaller, defense-oriented rollers loosely based on sphere morph designs. Each rover is 0.6 meters in diameter and, with its limbs retracted, has the ominous appearance of a reflective, shiny, black globe. It can extrude two manipulating arms and 2 other articulating weapon mounts equipped with a pistol and an agonizer on default models. Rovers are stealthy and highly maneuverable and so favored for bodyguard and police purposes in some areas. They are often deployed via remote control.

| **Eludere:** The LLA has started using large numbers of these in police actions, usually remote-puppeted. I think the security forces like the intimidation factor they provide. Even a case has some body language you can read, but a rolling black ball of death is the ultimate evolution of cop sunglasses.                                                      |
| **Pegasus:** That would explain why the Republic is experimenting with them on troublesome habitats. I heard from a contact that they’re more stripped down, with the cyberbrains and other ego-enhancing tech stripped out, and with the weapons systems replaced with nonlethal variants since we can’t just mow down civilians the way the rest of the system can. |

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Qi:** A few inner-system corps have taken the savant’s open-source designs and are rushing out their own models, but autonomist hacker groups have taken offense to that sort of profiteering and are seeding viruses that only affect various proprietary models around the inner system. |
| **Callosum:** In my experience, the accelerated intelligence neural modeling in synths like this (and also certain infomorphs) is a bit more prone to bugginess than wetware smart morphs. You tend to see higher rates of eccentricity and neurodiverse behavior.                           |

## Slitheroid

![Slitheroid](PNG/slitheroid.png)

Slitheroid shells take the form of a humanoid torso with retractable arms atop a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake. Slitheroids use lateral undulation to move, though they can also pull themselves along by their arms or coil, twist, and roll their bodies like a ball or hoop.

| **Stitch:** I don’t want to spoil the fun, but one of the biggest manufacturers of slitheroids has a habit of including “easter egg” features in their morphs. Each one tends to be unique.                                                                        |

## Smart Swarm

| **Stitch:** I know an AGI engineer who is a real master at using smart swarms. I’ve seen them shape mechanical structures like a track of ball bearings in order to slide something along. They’re also good at taking advantage of the environment to create more leverage, like an improvised pulley. It takes a lot of skill to pull those kinds of tricks off, though. |

## Spare

![Spare](PNG/spare.png)

Spares are small, portable shells designed as a temporary replacement sleeve should your primary morph be killed/destroyed. They are common gear for gatecrashing missions. Packed as a flat 15-centimeter disc, when activated they pop into a six-limbed spherical shape. Just plug your original cortical stack in and you are ready to go. Built-in stress-management systems help survivors handle the trauma of their recent death.

| **Parallax:** It never fails. You’re in the middle of admiring the leaves on that alien plant. Next thing you know, there’s a change of scenery, you’re significantly shorter, and start-up diagnostics are scrolling past. Gets you right in the gut.                   |
| **Nova Vida:** These are worth the hassle to bring along on gate ops — or any long-term, high‑risk field op.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Psychscraper:** As a psychosurgeon, I’ve noticed a number of my gatecrasher clients have developed a phobia of spares. Not surprising, since if you wake up in a spare you’re probably in a bad place, and the first thing you’re going to remember is how you bit it. |

## Sphere

![Sphere](PNG/sphere.png)

This utilitarian morph is a simple sphere one meter in diameter that rolls or hovers on thrust jets. It can extend four flexible manipulating limbs as needed. Its surface coating of quantum-dot imagers and chameleon skin enables it to see in all directions and display images and colors to emote. Given its lack of a humanoid visage, sphere cyberbrains feature enhancements to modules used in social interactions, making these morphs surprisingly personable.

| **Psychscaper:** They took a bold step giving these morphs realistic faces, rather than the usual abstract design. That’s been a no-no in the engineer’s playbook for decades. Humans don’t respond well to faces that are realistic but still artificial. They’re addressing that uncanny valley revulsion head on with these morphs, really embracing the otherness aspect and still claiming equal personhood. |

| **Delta-V:** I flew one of these into the sun once. I have never been so terrified in my life. Can’t wait to do it again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Rivet:** The sundiver is actually a fairly good all-purpose synth and there’s a lot of groups that have started using them in high heat and high rad environments other than stars. If you swap out the propulsion system for something that’s a little slower and gives a bit more control, they make pretty good gate crashing morphs as well. |

## Swarmanoid

![Swarmanoid](PNG/swarmanoid.png)

Swarmanoids are swarms composed of hundreds of insect-sized microbots. Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling, rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter fan blades for airlift. The cyberbrain, cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld” together into various loose shapes, it is incapable of physical tasks like grabbing, lifting, or holding. Individual bots are linked by radio and laser and are quite capable of interfacing with electronics.

| **Skinwalker:** This morph is rough to adapt to, but not for the reasons people think. Yeah, the sensory input is overloading, and simultaneous lack of a substantial body and the possession of thousands of small ones is a serious acclimation hurdle. What gets most people, though, is the frustration. Being severely limited in what you can physically do, from holding a cup to opening a door, tends to aggravate people and compound the alienation. |
| **Voight-Kampff:** I think that’s why you see a lot more AGIs using these when they want something that can operate physically. For them, it’s the opposite experience: you go from experiencing millions of things simultaneously to just a few hundreds to thousands of inputs, but it beats sleeving into something even less able.                                                                                                                          |

## Synth

![Synth](PNG/synth.png)

Synths are even more humanoid than cases and of better quality. They are commonly deployed for labor-intensive tasks in environments not suited for biomorphs or for people who need a body quickly and cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Most designs are anthropomorphic, though various alternatives exist, including some based on uplift physiology.

| **Skinwalker:** There are so many models of synth out there, they’re hard to classify. Quality ranges from walking junk to cutting-edge.                                                                                               |
| **Nevermore:** They make uplift versions too, particularly neo-hominids and neanderthals. Slightly different form, same function.                                                                                                      |
| **Lovelace:** Since these are so prevalent among the clanking masses — and uniform-looking out of the box — it’s quite the trend these days to glitter these up with custom paint jobs, aftermarket add-ons, and other aesthetic mods. |
| **Rivet:** Don’t forget the weird fashion of wearing clothes with your synth. I get that it makes you seem more human, but it sorta defeats the purpose in my book.                                                                    |

## Synthtaur

![Synthtaur](PNG/synthtaur.png)

The synthtaur’s smart material composition allows it to switch between two pre-set configurations in a matter of seconds. The first form resembles an elegant mechanical centaur, a two-armed quadruped 1.7 meters tall. The second form is a fourarmed biped 2.4 meters tall. This morph is popular with gatecrashers who must cover a lot of terrain on foot, people exploring ruined habitats, and anyone going into dangerous and remote situations.

| **Red Rover:** I’ve been seeing more of these in the Martian outback lately. The shape-changing makes them quite useful for nomads. I’m just waiting to see one painted green with tusks.                     |

## Takko

![Takko](PNG/takko.png)

The first synthetic cephalopod design from the engineers at Feral Robot is a hardy shell custom-designed to make neo-octopi uplifts feel more at home in a synthetic body with eight functioning appendages. Though it lacks a beak and ink sacs, the takko features thrust-vector jets for microgravity propulsion.

| **Skinwalker:** For human egos checking out the eight-armed life, takkos tend to be easier to acclimate to then octomorphs. The cyberbrain mind-states are more conducive to human mental frameworks.                                                                       |
| **Pivo:** These were a hit among neo-octopi when first released. There’s an ongoing complaint about the lack of chemoreceptors on the arms, though — imagine having a human biomorph with no sense of taste or smell — but the overall dexterity and design keeps us happy. |
| **Callosum:** The cyberbrains on these incorporate neo-octopi neurology for the arms, meaning that have a mind of their own, but they provide better proprioception than most octomorphs too.                                                                               |

## Xu Fu

![Xu Fu](PNG/xu-fu.png)

Named after a historical Chinese explorer, many gatecrashers consider xu fus the ideal exoplanet exploration synthmorph. Its main body sits atop 6 legs that end in multidirectional smart wheels for quick travel, capable of rolling in any direction and over rough terrain. For exceptionally difficult terrain, the wheels can be retracted and the xu fu can maneuver as a walker. In addition to two standard arms, it features a lower third arm for collecting samples and an upper telescoping fourth arm for reaching far distances and overseeing obstacles. All arms are retractable. Xu fus have an impressive sensor package and are ideal for surface-based scouting, investigating tunnels, and other gatecrashing tasks.
