| **Volta:** Augurs, for when your corporate masters want you smart as a menton, but as easily controlled as a bot. |
| **Psychscaper:** That’s why so many of these models also come with built-in behavioral mods.                      |

## Ayah

![Ayah](PNG/ayah.png)

Ayahs are designed for nurse, caretaking, and personal attendant functions. Hyperelites prefer AGI servants sleeved into ayahs, especially in polities where AGIs have few, if any, legal rights. Ayahs are predominately female. Enhanced olfactory capabilities are used to monitor the health and emotional state of their wards, as well as alert them to potential environmental dangers. Their ability to withstand temperature extremes and survive without air for short periods helps them protect and rescue their charges in an emergency, such as a hull breach or a fire.

| **AYAH**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Eludere:** This is a great morph to sleeve if you want to come across as safe and innocuous. No one suspects an ayah — until you’ve had one try to feed your head into the kitchen disassembler.                                                                       |
| **Ammonite:** AI-piloted defender ayahs are very common inside the mansions of the ultrarich, usually heavily loaded with intriguing aftermarket add-ons. Don’t be surprised if there’s also an infomorph on hand to drop in and take it over when alarms start ringing. |
| **Nezumi:** I know a commune out near Neptune where the males all sleeve male ayahs and the women wear furies, just to tweak the gender dynamics.                                                                                                                        |

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Expat:** I know the pre-Fall models had limited lifespans just as a precaution, to keep the AIs in line. That still the case?                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Skinwalker:** Yes. Some of these basics are as bad as mass-market case morphs or low-grade rusters. Planned obsolescence is common. Buyer beware.                                                                                                                                         |
| **Qi:** It’s worse than that. It’s common practice among inner-system pod manufacturers to equip their models with free chemical dependencies. They know pods are the next thing above a synthmorph for indentures looking to buy out, and they do everything they can to keep them hooked. |

## Chickcharnie

![Chickcharnie](PNG/chickcharnie.png)

The genehackers at the extrasolar Fortean hab modeled this morph on a terrifying mythological bird using genetics from the extinct Tyto Pollens, a large pre-Columbian flightless ground owl. The chickcharnie is popular with neo-avians who prefer a more humanoid stature, though it is flightless except in very low grav environments and microgravity. Its wing design incorporates a functional set of clawed hands.

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skinwalker:** These are unfortunately hard to find.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Sequencer:** That hasn’t gone unnoticed. I know a couple of Extropian bodycraft houses that plan to release their own models next year. One of them has an interesting variant called the “owlbear.” I’m not sure I want to know. |
| **Just Mortal:** What I don’t get is, why does this appeal to neo-avians? Sure, it’s a bird, but you lose the wings.                                                                                                                |
| **Nevermore:** Ever tried to tie a knot with your tongue? Yeah, sometimes a good pair of hands is worth the trade-off.                                                                                                              |

## Critter

![Critter](PNG/critter.png)

Critter pods encompass a vast variety of morphs based on animal genetics, chimeric blends, or humanoids biosculpted to an animalistic form. Originally marketed as distinctive AI-operated pets, they’ve since become a popular and widespread choice of sleeve. Critters come in every conceivable species and hybrid, from cats to snakes to lizardhyena hybrids. They are available as quadrupeds, bipeds, and other body plans. The bastet, a composite of wild cat species that resembles a tawny panther or lion, often with intricate fur patterns based on Egyptian hieroglyphs, is currently popular in the inner system.

## Digger

![Digger](PNG/digger.png)

Diggers are worker pods customized for archeological and construction work. They are used for surface surveys, excavation, and general physical labor by xenoarcheological and colony infrastructure teams. Their hands are modified digging claws, adapted from the genetics of hole-digging creatures like moles and aardvarks, though still flexible and useful for grasping and fine manipulation.

| **Skinwalker:** The giant hands are surprisingly dexterous, but forget wearing anything but smart gloves.                                                                             |
| **Sequencer:** A number of diggers have polydactyl hands, meaning they have an extra thumb. Makes it easier to hold on to things.                                                     |
| **Nova Vida:** If you’re actually using this morph for tunnel exploration/ excavation, get a model with the mole hemoglobin protein — it lets you survive in low oxygen environments. |

## Flying Squid

![Flying Squid](PNG/flying-squid.png)

Capitalizing on the popularity of octomorphs, this stylized squid is designed for speed in both aquatic and microgravity environments. It can suck either water or air into a cavity in its mantle and then expel it out a siphon for fast, jet-like propulsion.

| **Delta-V:** Quite an interesting ride, but useless in any non-aquatic environment with gravity.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Pivo:** You hear about that situation on Atlantica? A certain neo-whale there ate a couple of folks sleeved in flying squid morphs. They claimed they couldn’t tell ‘em apart from their nonsapient squid feedstock. Word on the waves is that some sort of black market deal went sour.                     |
| **Expat:** I know some reclaimers who came across a group of flying squid morphs while doing recon on Earth, looking for a deep sea sanctuary. The squid scattered before they could make contact. Interesting thing is: these morphs were first designed after the Fall. So why are they showing up on Earth? |

## Hypergibbon

![Hypergibbon](PNG/hypergibbon.png)

Gibbons are not a candidate for uplift due to their primitive brain anatomy, but they make excellent pods with the addition of a cyberbrain. Many primate uplifts choose hypergibbons when they need something small like a neotenic. Built from siamang genestock, the largest of the lesser apes, hypergibbons stand about 1 meter tall, weigh 15 kilograms, and typically have black fur and skin (although bodysculpting permits many variations). They have inflatable throat sacks that allow melodious calls that carry great distances. Their wrists feature a ball-and-socket joint and also naturally dislocate to enable easier swinging by the arms.

| **Chiro:** I kind of want to fork some children and sleeve them in hypergibbons, but that’d probably be introducing a new x-risk.                                              |
| **Skinwalker:** I keep a couple of hypergibbon sleeves around for my forks. They’re very handy for home projects — they can get into anything, and their energy is infectious. |

## Novacrab

![Novacrab](PNG/novacrab.png)

Bioengineered from coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a larger (human) size, novacrabs are ideal for hazardous work environments as well as vacworker, police, or bodyguard duties. They climb and handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure changes) from vacuum to deep sea. They are equipped with ten 2-meter long legs, massive claws, chitinous armor, compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution), gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on their fifth set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.

## Pleasure Pod

![Pleasure Pod](PNG/pleasure-pod.png)

Pleasure pods are faux humans intended for intimate entertainment purposes and indulgent hedonism. Their biology includes extra nerve clusters in their erogenous zones, fine motor control over certain muscle groups, enhanced pheromones, sanitized metabolisms, and the capability to purr. They are capable of switching between multiple sex configurations and are often enhanced in other areas.

## Ripwing

![Ripwing](PNG/ripwing.png)

Developed by the genehackers of Fortean, ripwings are neogenetic avian chimeras, incorporating completely novel genes with traits from a range of flying creatures, including prehistoric pterosaurs. Larger and sturdier than standard neo-avian morphs, ripwings are popular with avian uplifts who want a more robust form and gatecrashers looking for a quick and stealthy flyer for recon missions. Ripwings take advantage of the _chiroptera_ genestock used to give the first avian uplifts functional hands. Instead of feathers, they feature tough leathery skin or even scales. Most ripwings have a uniform matte black skin coloration, though they are able to change color at will.

| **Nevermore:** I’ve seen more and more young neo-avian uplifts sleeving into ripwings.

## Samsa

![Samsa](PNG/samsa.png)

The samsa is an intimidating, two-meter-tall, four-armed, four-legged, humanoid insect. An unsettling sight to many transhumans, it was the first attempt to create a combat pod with a terrifying appearance. They are most commonly used by rimward mercenaries and enforcers. Their armored carapace provides protection and the extra limbs allow them to carry multiple weapons.

| **Callosum:** The synaptic programming in some samsa cyberbrain models is a bit rough, if you ask me. In particular, the extra limbs are not always designed to be operated independently; sometimes they mirror the primary limbs. This is allegedly a “feature” for users who aren’t acclimated to multilimb body plans, but it can be a real pain when you need to concentrate to move your appendages independently. Plus, it means a good brainhacker can trigger this mirroring behavior if they compromise your security. Not so good when you’re in the middle of a firefight. |
| **Pivo:** I can’t speak for all neo-octopi, but you can definitely tell some of these models were designed for native two-arms, two-leg users. Like Callosum said, they really aren’t optimized to make the best use of those secondary arms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Security Pod

![Security Pod](PNG/security-pod.png)

Security pods were originally manufactured as mass-produced AI-operated soldiers for joint peacekeeping missions and enclave border/security roles. Many were co-opted by the TITANs during the Fall, so they fell out of favor for many years, but a demand for cheap mercenary morphs has revived interest.

| **Parallax:** Ah, the good old toy soldiers fielded by so many pre-Fall militaries and then exploited by the TITANs during the Fall. I guess you can’t really fault the old Earth governments too much, they seemed like a good deal. They were loyal, durable, looked near enough to human that people didn’t complain too much, followed orders, and even sometimes had actual human egos in them. They lost popularity, of course, after the TITANs took over legions of sec pods and used them to commit all sorts of atrocities, but they’re making a comeback. |
| **Rivet:** Some people think these were always under direct TITAN control. Not true. It was common for them just to reprogram the ALIs. So be careful about any sec pods you find lingering in long-lost habs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
