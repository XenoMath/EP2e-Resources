## Scurrier

![Scurrier](PNG/scurrier.png)

Scurriers are developed from sciurids, a non-sapient extraterrestrial species similar to hexapod, raccoon-sized flying squirrels. Cute and colorful, they are also extremely fast and agile. They make excellent climbers, gliders, and tunnel workers.

| **Plasmid:** There are two models of these floating around: quadrupred and hexaped. The former is for people that don’t adjust to the extra limbs as well.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Nezumi:** Can any of you smart gals, guys, or others that actually do morph design tell me exactly why this thing needed vocal cords that make it sound like a four-year-old child on helium? These things are useful for getting into hard-to-reach places, but no one can take that cartoon voice seriously. |
| **Plasmid:** I heard the voice tested well in focus groups, so put that one on the marketing folks.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Skinwalker:** The vocals were the very first thing I modded when I tried this morph out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Quadruped Variant

This four-limbed version of the scurrier is easier to adapt to.

## Whiplash

![Whiplash](PNG/whiplash.png)

Designed by autonomist xenobotanists, these pods are bio-engineered from the predatory whiplash creatures found on the exoplanet Sunrise, with additional transgenic features. The primary modification made to the original creature was to turn the entire organism upside down and orient the digestive portion of the organism horizontally, so that the whiplash’s tri-lobed orifice faces forward. The whiplash’s grasping roots were also converted into even more motile “walking tentacles.” Other adjustments include the addition of a pair of grasping limbs, each with four universally opposable digits; artificial sensing mods (providing transhuman-standard sensing ability); and a general toughening of the internal structure for rigidity and support. The ability to extend and retract the whiplash’s feeding tendril was heavily enhanced, so now the tendril acts more like a two-meter-long chameleon-like tongue than a hanging food-trap.

Although whiplash morphs are unusual even by transhuman standards, they are gaining traction among gatecrashers working in arboreal environments.

| **Just Mortal:** One word: Ick.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Skinwalker:** One person’s squick is another’s dream. I wouldn’t mind giving an alien pod a spin, just for the experience.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Sun Bu’er:** You might want to wait to the third or fourth generation. I hear the experience of sleeving these is still a bit rough. I don’t think they’ve fully worked out the bugs when it comes to streamlining the alien biochemistry with the cyberbrain’s simulated biochemical states. |
| **Lovelace:** I know I was told that in the future I could be anything, but I never really imagined that would including being a houseplant.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Nova Vida:** In all seriousness, these don’t see much use outside of certain gatecrashing ops. I’ve used one once and it has a lot more synthetic interface elements than most pods, not sure if this is because of the plant or the alien aspects though.                                    |
| **Plasmid:** I did a bit of spec consulting on the whiplash and IIRC it’s the plant elements; the sensory elements of flora are so much different from ours that it required major work.                                                                                                        |
