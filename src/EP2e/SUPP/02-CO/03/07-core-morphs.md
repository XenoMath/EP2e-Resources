## Overmind

Overminds are the top tier of core morphs. They are found in highsecurity habitats, military ships, prisons, and similar infrastructures.

| **Njál:** My friend refers to these as “infomorph god mode.”                                                                                    |
| **Voight-Kampff:** There’s a reason why overminds are often monitored by security for signs of intelligence augmentation or exponential growth. |

## Sexton

![Sexton](PNG/sexton.png)

Sexton core systems manage larger habitats and ships. They rely on multiple egos — often forks of the same individual — to manage all sub-systems in coordination with each other.

| **Yemaja:** The interesting bit about core morphs is how much they come to know about the people they oversee. I know the surveillance is creepy to some, but the familiarity it breeds is fascinating. |

## Warden

![Warden](PNG/warden.png)

Wardens are basic core cyberbrain systems, commonly used in smaller habitats and ships. They are designed so that a single ego can handle all subsystems.

| **Ammonite:** The utility of wardens for maintaining operational security over your base of operations is criminally overlooked. If you’re going to operate out of the same module for more than a week, set up a warden and drop a fork in it. When the opposition comes sniffing around, you’ll thank me. |
