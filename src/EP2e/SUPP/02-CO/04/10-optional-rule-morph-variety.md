# Optional Rule: Morph Variety

In some circumstances, GMs may wish to add some variety to the morphs that appear in game. Most morphs have had previous owners who may have modified them, treated them particularly poorly, or gone above and beyond to maintain them. While body banks strive to keep their stock in good shape, high demand and turnover and long periods of being in use take their toll. Morph suppliers also sometimes add features to morphs to make them more appealing to potential customers.

When using this rule, any morph you present in game has a 10% chance of having variant features. In these cases, roll 2d10 and consult the Morph Variety table.

When used for NPCs, this is a good way of keeping players on their toes, especially if they know the morphs well. For PCs, this is an option for spicing up the usual morph selection.
