### Aggressive GRM

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This trait is only available to biomorphs. The genetic rights management of this morph uses a number of atypical tricks to prevent the morph from breeding or being modified without authorization.

Unless “unlocked” with further genehacking by someone with detailed knowledge of the original design or by a Medicine: Biotech Test at −30, the morph is sterile and will reject all bioware, cyberware, and nanoware mods not included in the original design (if installed, treat as a wound until they are removed).

### Emotive

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This trait only applies to synthmorphs. The emotive range of this morph is exceptional. Kinesics Tests made against you do not suffer the usual −30 modifier for synthmorphs.

### Fast Metabolism

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This trait is only available to biomorphs and is typically only found in heavily enhanced ones. Your morph’s metabolism runs hot, requiring you to eat 2–3 times as much food as a similar morph of equivalent mass. While autocooks make food plentiful and cheap, this trait can pose a problem in remote locations or settlements with limited resources.

Treat this as a Minor complexity daily requirement in situations of food scarcity.

If you fail to acquire the amount of food you need more than 2 days in a row, lower your Wound Threshold by 1 and Durability by 5 (recalculating your DR as DUR x 1.5) until you resume your usual caloric intake. For every additional 2 days without enough food, reduce Wound Threshold and Durability by an equivalent amount. If Durability reaches 5, you will soon die without extended medical care.

### Grav Sickness

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 2**

This trait is only available to biomorphs. This morph is adapted for low-gravity environments (0.15 or less) and struggles in higher gravity. You suffer the effects of [high gravity](../../../12/28-environmental-factors.md#high-gravity) (_EP2_) for every 0.2&nbsp;g over 0.15. On Mars or Mercury (0.38&nbsp;g), you would suffer the effects of 1 wound; on Venus or Earth (1&nbsp;g), you suffer the effects of 4 wounds.

### Impaired Balance

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1/2**

This trait is only available to neo-pigs and other morphs derived from non-bipeds. The morph’s brain is not fully adjusted to its upright posture and bipedal stance. You suffer a −10 modifier per level to Athletics or Pilot Tests involving balance or upright movement.

### Impaired Hearing

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This trait is most common with neo-octopi and other morphs derived from species that lack the full range of human hearing. The morph lacks the transgenic hearing mods of modern designs. It can only hear sounds in the 400–1,000&nbsp;kHz range (as opposed to the 20–20,000&nbsp;kHz range of transhumans) and hears poorly when not underwater. Apply a −30 to hearing-based Perceive Tests. Some medium- and high-frequency sounds may be entirely inaudible (GM discretion).

### Impaired Proprioception

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 2**

This trait is most common with neo-octopi, flying squid, and other morphs derived from species that lack normal human proprioception (your sense of the position and movement of your body parts). You only know where your limbs and other parts are by looking at them; they often move of their own accord. You suffer a −10 to Fray Tests and your limbs are often getting caught in doors, unconsciously grabbing things, knocking things over, or otherwise getting in the way (providing additional narrative options for superior and critical failures).

### Lack of Manipulators

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 2**

This morph lacks hands or other limbs with a fine manipulation capability. It is a common trait with quadrupeds (as well as certain smart animals). A morph with this trait may not be able to manipulate objects at all or may only be able to do so with a very limited capacity. Some morphs can hold small-sized objects between their paws or in their mouths, for example, but unless these items have been specifically designed to operate with this morphology, you suffer a −30 modifier or may not be able to use them at all (GM discretion). Objects that don’t require physical manipulation, such as tools controlled by wireless commands, may be used normally. Some morphs with this trait — particularly quadrupeds — may be unable to hold an object between their paws and move at the same time or may require a REF Check to retain their balance while standing upright to hold something.

### Lack of Smell

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This morph lacks functioning olfactory organs and/or capabilities, meaning you cannot smell. You are oblivious to the scents of cooking food, perfume, rot, body odor, smoke, and odorants added to dangerous chemicals, among other things. This also likely diminishes your ability to taste; many foods taste the same. You are immune to the effects of enhanced pheromones.

### Neurochemical Imbalance

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 3**

Your morph’s neurochemistry (or its neurochemical simulators) is unbalanced. You suffer from sudden mood swings and strong, almost overwhelming, emotions. The GM makes a list of 6 [Enhanced Behavior (Level 2) trait](../../../04/28-traits.md#enhanced-behavior) (_EP2_), all at Level 2. Examples include sadness, despair, frustration, anxiety, loneliness, euphoria, manic intensity, arousal, contrariness, and so on. Each time you spend a pool point or make a WIL Check, roll 1d6 to choose which of those Enhanced Behavior traits kicks in. The Enhanced Behaviors apply at Level 2 and affect you for 1d6 hours.

You may use drugs, psychosurgery, or certain ware (such as neuromodulation or endocrine control) to counteract these Enhanced Behaviors, reducing them to Level 1 or blocking them entirely (GM discretion). However, ware used this way may not be used to trigger other emotions at the same time. At the GM’s discretion, certain situations may exacerbate or limit the Enhanced Behaviors (to Level 1 or Level 3 as appropriate).

### Personality Artifact

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 2**

Echoes of previous egos that inhabited this morph linger as enduring mental imprints and occasionally intrude, altering your disposition. Work with your GM to generate 6 personality traits that differ from your norm, expressing each an [Enhanced Behavior (Level 2) trait](../../../04/28-traits.md#enhanced-behavior) (_EP2_) or a motivation (replacing an existing one when triggered). Once per session, you or the GM can assert that one of these artifacts is activated and changes your personality; roll 1d6 to determine which. The triggering condition may be taking stress, interacting with specifc environments or circumstances, rolling a critical failure, or random chance. Artifacts stay in effect for 1d6 days and are completely natural and “in character” to your affected ego, no matter how drastic a change.

Each time an artifact is invoked, make a Willpower Stress Test against SV 1d6 (more if the change is at strong contrast or antithetical to your usual self ). Artifacts may be temporarily removed with psychosurgery, but never fully erased (i.e., they can be triggered again).

### Whole Body Apoptosis

**▼ Morph Trait • MP Bonus: 1**

This trait may only be applied to biomorphs. This morph is genetically programmed to suffer a sudden and lethal massive cellular failure at some point in the future, usually within a given 10-year period, though it is possible to target a specific date, give or take a few months. Bioconservatives favor this ware to die quickly and naturally. The cellular failure takes about 10 minutes to complete, giving you just enough time to send final messages. It only applies an MP Bonus if you agree that the GM may at any point turn a critical failure you roll into a regular failure and then trigger the apoptosis within the next 24 hours (in-game).
