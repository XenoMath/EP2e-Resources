# Enhanced & Elite Morphs

The morphs described in _EP2_ are generally designed as bare-bones models — they only incorporate the ware that is essential to that morph’s function. This serves to both keep the morph costs low and to leave the morphs as blank slates that individual users can further customize with Gear Points or Morph Points.

However, there are many packages of mods that are likely in high demand, whether for specific environments or for specific functions. For example, biomorphs on Mars are often expected to have the same mods that allow rusters to more easily navigate the Martian outdoors. Various combat mods are in demand for morphs sleeved for security purposes. Morphs used in academic circles are often requested with intelligence and study enhancements. Gatecrashers demand morphs equipped for surviving exoplanet environments. And the socialite party circuit creates a high-demand for morphs with drugware and other endowments.

To simulate this, GMs can allow the following mod packages, which each bundle together several high-demand mods at a reduced cost. Body banks and morph boutiques offer these as “enhanced” and “elite” packages to discerning customers.

**Availability:** The availability of enhanced and elite models is left to the GM. Location is likely to be a large factor — the Mars Essentials pack is widely available on Mars, but almost unheard of on Venus. At the GM’s discretion, some packages may reduce a morph’s Availability by −10 to −30 or may only be an option if you score a superior success on the Availability roll. If purchasing multiple morphs, any morphs after the first with a base cost of 0 MP cost 1 MP before you apply a package’s MP modifier.

**Redundant Ware:** Some of these packs may provide ware that is already included in the morph or in one of the PC’s gear packs. In this case, simply allow the player to swap out the repeated ware for something of an equivalent GP cost.

**Multiple Packages:** A morph may have more than one package, but this will likely reduce Availability (GM discretion).
