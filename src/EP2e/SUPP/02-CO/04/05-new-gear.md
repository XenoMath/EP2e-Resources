## Monitor ALI

These ALIs reside within ghostrider modules installed to watch over their carrier’s activities. They are used to watch over prisoners and parolees, civilians living under police states, and people restricted with second-class citizenship like uplifts and indentures in some polities. They are also sometimes deployed in high-security installations or criminal or hypercorp operations where secrecy and accountability are prerogatives.

## Optional Rule: Quantum-dot Cameras

In the world of Eclipse Phase, almost all cameras (including the cyber-eyes of synthmorphs and some biomorphs) use quantum- dot sensor technology.

In simple terms, this means that the camera sensors produce higher-resolution terapixel images. Fullerene arrays of quantum dots can be printed on almost any surface, and quantum dots can both detect and emit light. This means that almost any wall or surface — including flexible materials like clothes or paper — can be transformed into a combination visual sensor and display.

### Optional Rule

For a more complex but scientifically plausible take on quantum-dot cameras, they can also perceive infrared and ultraviolet frequencies (at no extra cost/complexity). Additionally, while most quantum-dot visual sensors still use lenses to focus light and zoom in on distant objects, simpler quantum-dot displays/sensors used in advertisements or for non-intrusive security purposes lack lenses entirely. This means that they cannot be spotted or blinded by lens-detection systems of dazzlers. They are also more difficult to spot visually when they are not displaying images: apply a −20 to Perceive Tests.
