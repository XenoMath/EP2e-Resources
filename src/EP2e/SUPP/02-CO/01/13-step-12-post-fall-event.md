This step deals with more recent changes to your character’s life. Did you run across some hazard that survived the Fall? Were you recruited for a gatecrashing mission? Did you switch faction allegiances? Maybe you picked up a hobby or a an odd skill on the side? What sparked or motivated these changes?
