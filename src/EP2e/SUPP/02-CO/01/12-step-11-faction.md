# Step 11: Faction

<div class="no-margin">
<blockquote class="header-bg">

**Your character’s factional allegiance determines which faction your character associates with at the start of gameplay. Choose or roll a faction on the Faction table.**

**You acquire the Know: \[Faction\] Interests 20 skill, as appropriate to the faction. Though not required, you may also want to consider changing one of your motivations to fit this faction’s ideologies and goals. Then move on Step 12. If you end up with no faction or split allegiances, you may apply the 20 Know skill points to a Know skill of your choice (or [roll](24-skill-tables.md#know-fields-d100)).**

**THE STORY:**

As the old ways of living crumbled and were forgotten, new ideas and societies rose up offering promises of hope, wealth, or safety. Many people left behind their old lives to join new communities or leveraged their hard-won skills into positions of power or influence. What became readily apparent in the post-Fall world was that you needed allies, or at least friends you could depend on to help you and keep you safe. This step encapsulates your allegiances and work in the time after the Fall. The chosen faction indicates where you are likely to live, who you associate with, and what political opinions you are likely to have.

Faction allegiance does not necessarily mean you are a hardcore true believer. You may have been born or raised into a faction and reluctantly stuck with it, or you may be finding yourself questioning some of the faction’s tenets. You may be a dissident, trying to actively change the faction from within. For now, your faction allegiance indicates the transhuman grouping you are most familiar with and whose goals you at least nominally support. Perhaps you are even a defector or new recruit, with a Know skill in your old faction but a motivation tied to your new one.
