**Story events are background elements that do not have a game effect on your character, but are included for potential roleplaying and plot purposes. Some of the results on the earlier event tables may have instructed you to roll on this table.**

**As a final step, you may roll on the Story Event table to determine a recent event in your character’s life.**

**This may help define what your character is doing or concerned with at the beginning of gameplay. It may also be used to tie your character to the other player characters in the game.**
