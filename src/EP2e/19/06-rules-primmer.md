# Rules Primer

<blockquote>

## Ego vs. Morph

Your capabilities are divided between your _ego_ (your mind, skills, and memories that travel with you from body to body) and your _morph_ (the body you currently inhabit).

## Making Tests

### Roll d100 (0–99)

- Target number is determined by the appropriate skill, aptitude check, or rep score.
- Difficulty is represented by _modifiers_ to this target number, assigned by the GM.
- Your goal is to roll equal to or under the modified target number, but as high as possible.
- A roll equal to or under the target number is a success. If the success roll is 33 or more, it is a _superior success_. If it is a 66 or more, it is two superior successes.
- If your roll exceeds the target number, it is a failure. If the failed roll is under 66, it is a _superior failure_. If it is under 33, it counts as two superior failures.
- Doubles (00, 11, etc.) equal a _critical success_ or _failure_.
- 00 is always a critical success. 99 is always a critical failure.
- If you do not have the appropriate skill, you may _default_ to the skill’s linked aptitude, but critical successes are ignored.
- If you fail, you may try again (unless the GM disallows it), with a cumulative −10 modifier.

</blockquote>

## Opposed Tests

- If you are acting in opposition to another character, you both make a test, rolling d100 against skill +/− modifiers.
- Whomever succeeds _and_ rolls highest wins.

## Modifiers

- Modifiers always affect the target number (skill), not the roll.
- Modifiers (positive or negative) come in 3 levels of severity:
- Minor (+/−10)
- Moderate (+/−20)
- Major (+/−30)
- The maximum modifiers that can be applied are +/−60.

## Specializations

- Specializations add +10 when using a skill for that area of concentration. Each skill may have only one specialization.

## Superior Results

For one superior result, choose one of the following. For two superior results, choose two or one twice for double effects:

- **Quality:** The work is more exact (success) or more sloppy (failure). This may affect subsequent tests by +/−10.
- **Quantity:** The test consumes fewer (success) or more (failure) materials or produces fewer or more results.
- **Detail:** You acquire information that is much more in-depth/nuanced (success) or false (failure).
- **Time (task actions only):** The action takes a shorter (success) or longer (failure) amount of time, by +/−25%.
- **Covertness:** The action is less (success) or more (failure) obvious or draws less or more attention (+/−10 as appropriate).
- **Damage:** Successes inflict more (+1d6) damage (failures miss).

## Critical Results

Criticals (“crits”) have more impact than superior results. They represent “Wow!” moments where you stun onlookers with incredible proficiency or ineptness. They provide extra effects/penalties, as determined by the GM. Here are some examples:

- Double the damage you inflict with an attack.
- Gain a +/−20 modifier to the next test you make.
- Take an extra action (critical success) or lose your next action (critical failure).
- Break a weapon/tool (critical failure).

## Teamwork

- One character is chosen as the primary actor; they make the test.
- Each helper character adds a +10 modifier (max. +30).
- For Know, Technical, or Vehicle skill tests, collaborating characters must possess the skill at 40+ to provide a teamwork bonus.

## Action Turns

Action Turns are roughly 3 seconds in length.

- In each action turn you may undertake one of the following:
  - 1 complex action and 1 quick action
  - 1 task action and 1 quick action
  - 3 quick actions
- You may also take unlimited automatic actions.

## Task Actions

- Task actions are any action that requires longer than 1 action turn to complete.
- Task actions list a timeframe (anywhere from 2 turns to 2 years).
- Timeframes may be adjusted by superior results.
- You may take extra time, applying a +10 modifier for a 25% increase to the timeframe.
- You may rush the job, reducing the timeframe by 25% but applying a −20 modifier.
- If you fail, you expend 25% of the timeframe, +25% per superior failure, before you realize you have failed.

## Initiative

- The order in which you act is determined by rolling 1d6 and adding your Initiative stat.
- The highest result goes first; others follow in descending order.
- On tied initiatives, you go simultaneously or use REF or a roll-off to determine order.
- You may _delay_ and act later in Initiative order; the count on which you act becomes your Initiative in subsequent turns.

<blockquote>

## Using Rep

Use your rep scores to pursue favors such as acquiring goods, services, or info.

Each rep score applies only to the people/factions affiliated with that particular social network.

- Make a Rep Test, using your rep score as the target number.
- The type of favor you are asking for modifies the target number: Minor (+10), Moderate (+0), or Major (−30).
- You can intentionally take a negative modifier to a Rep Test to keep your request quiet and hidden from others. The same modifier applies to anyone making a Rep Test to find out what you’re up to.
- Favors have limits in how often they can be used: Minor (3 per week), Moderate (1 per week), Major (1 per story arc).
- You can burn rep (permanently lower your rep score) for additional favors (at a cost of 5 for Minor, 10 for Moderate, 20 for Major) or to get a modifier to a Rep Test (equal to burn points × 2).

## Using Pools

Your character has a number of pools that define their transhuman capabilities. Most pools are derived from your morph, but some Flex points come from your ego.

- Each pool is linked to a different group of aptitudes and skills and may be used in unique ways to modify your rolls or provide other bonuses.
- Each pool may only be used for tests that use their linked skills or aptitudes (i.e., a Vigor point can be used on a skill test or aptitude check linked to REF or SOM). Flex may be used on any tests.
- Unless otherwise noted, only 1 pool point may be spent per test.

<blockquote class="indent">

- **Before Roll:** Ignore all modifiers to the test.
- **Before Roll:** Add +20 to the test’s target number.
- **After Roll:** Flip-flop a d100 roll. For example, 83 becomes 38.
- **After Roll:** Upgrade a success to a superior success (or one to two).
- **After Roll:** Downgrade a critical failure to a regular failure.
- **Ongoing (Insight/Moxie/Vigor Only):** Receive +5 (1 point) or +10 (2 points) to all skill tests linked to one aptitude for 24 hours or until your next recharge.

</blockquote>

## Insight

Insight pool is linked to mental capabilities: Cognition, Intuition, and their linked skills.

<blockquote class="indent">

- **Take the Initiative:** Go first in an action turn if you are only taking mental or mesh actions and no physical movement.
- **Extra Action:** Take an extra complex mental or mesh action (or 2 quick actions) in an action turn.
- **Acquire a Clue:** Gain a hint or lead through investigation, research, or analysis of the facts at hand, without needing to make a test.

</blockquote>

## Moxie

Moxie pool is linked to social interactions: Savvy, Willpower, and linked skills. It may also be used for Rep and Infection Tests.

<blockquote class="indent">

- **Ignore Trauma:** Ignore the effects of 1 trauma for 24 hours.
- **Refresh Rep:** Restore rep network favors at a cost of 1 point for a Minor favor and 2 points for a Moderate favor. Major favors may not be refreshed this way.
- **Acquire a Clue:** Get a tip or lead by gathering information via social interactions without needing to make a test.
- **Control Your Infection:** Avoid making an Infection Test when using a psi sleight (asyncs only).
- **Negate Gaffe:** Ignore a player’s social gaffe that the character wouldn’t make.

</blockquote>

## Vigor

Vigor pool is linked to physical efforts: Reflexes, Somatics, and their linked skills.

<blockquote class="indent">

- **Take the Initiative:** Go first in an action turn.
- **Extra Action:** Take an extra complex physical action (or 2 quick actions) in an action turn.
- **Ignore Wound:** Ignore the effects of 1 wound for 24 hours.

</blockquote>

## Flex

Flex is a wild-card pool. It can be used to affect dice rolls for any tests and for narrative control.

<blockquote class="indent">

- **Introduce NPC:** A new or existing NPC joins the scene. Their presence must be plausible. You may define one aspect of this NPC: their morph, factional allegiance, a noteworthy skill, a specific trait, etc.
- **Introduce an Item:** A previously unnoticed item is added to the scene. Its presence must be plausible. The item cannot be offensive (no weapons) and it must be of Minor (not Rare or Restricted) Complexity. It can be a useful tool, a necessary piece of gear, or even a clue.
- **Define the Environment:** You may introduce an environmental factor to a scene. Its presence must be plausible. It should provide a new detail that does not drastically alter the scene. Examples include hiding spots, cover, distractions, shelter, or exploitable elements such as a ladder or window.
- **Define a Relationship:** You may introduce a new, plausible relationship between your character and an existing NPC. This connection should be more loose or minor than close or serious. For example, you may have a common friend, shared history, or old but minor rivalry.

</blockquote>

## Recharging Pools

You recover the points you have spent from pools by taking a recharge action to rest and recalibrate. You can’t increase a pool above its original rating; unspent points are lost.

- **Short Recharge (2/day):** Short recharges are a task action with a timeframe of 10 minutes. You may take two short recharges per 24-hour period. Each short recharge restores 1d6 pool points; you decide where to allocate them.
- **Long Recharge (1/day):** A long recharge is a task action with a timeframe of 4 hours (8 for flats and other biomorphs without biomods). You may only benefit from one long recharge per 24-hour period. A long recharge completely restores your pools to their full value.

<blockquote class="framed-table">

## Combat

**Combat is an opposed test.**

- Attacker rolls attack skill +/− modifiers.
- Melee: Defender rolls Fray or Melee skill +/− modifiers.
- Ranged: Defender rolls (Fray skill ÷ 2) +/− modifiers.
- If attacker succeeds and rolls higher than the defender, the attack hits. Roll damage.
- Superior hits inflict +1d6&nbsp;DV.
- Critical hits double the DV.
- The weapon’s damage is reduced by the target’s energy or kinetic armor, as appropriate.
- If the damage equals or exceeds the target’s Wound Threshold, a wound is scored. If the damage equals or exceeds the target’s Wound Threshold by multiple factors, multiple wounds are inflicted.
- If total damage reaches Durability, the target is incapacitated. If it reaches Death Rating, they are killed/destroyed.

## Hacking

**Hacking Tests are opposed tests, your Infosec skill vs. the target’s Firewall.**

- When hacking a target, there are two methods you can go about it:
  - **Brute-Force-Attacks** are quick and noisy. They require a complex action and inflict a −30 modifier to your Hacking Tests. If you succeed, you have _user privileges_ on the system but also _spotted status_ (the system is aware of your intrusion).
  - **Subtle Intrusions** are quiet but take time. They are task actions with a timeframe of 1 hour. If you succeed, you have _user privileges_ on the system and _covert status_ (the system is unaware of your presence).
- Each superior success on the Hacking Test increases your privileges one step (from user to security to admin).
- A critical success on the Hacking Test increases your status one step (from spotted to covert to hidden).
- When intruding, you do not need to make tests for actions your privileges allow. For other actions, you must succeed in additional Hacking Tests.
