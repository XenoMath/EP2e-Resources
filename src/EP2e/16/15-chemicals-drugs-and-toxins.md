# Chemicals, Drugs, & Toxins

The transhuman desire to enhance the body and mind melds neatly with our species' history of recreational substance abuse. Drugs of all kinds — chemical, nano, or electronic — are not only popular but widespread. Advances in biotechnology have eliminated many of the side effects, but transhuman bodies are complicated environments, so they remain a factor, especially with long-term use.

Drugs are available in a variety of forms: pills, slap patches, inhalers, disposable injectors, liquids, powders, etc. The drugs here are just a representative sampling. There are thousands if not millions of drugs in circulation in Eclipse Phase — GMs are encouraged to introduce their own, using these as guidelines.

Note that some drugs may have different effects on morphs with the Non-Human Biochemistry trait (GM discretion).

**Complexity:** The listed Complexity is for 5 doses/applications of the chemical, drug, or toxin.

## Drug and Toxin Rules

Every substance has a type (determining what it can affect), an application method (how it is deployed), and an effect (what it does).

### Types

There are three classifications:

**Biochem:** These are natural biological substances and compounds produced by chemical synthesis, nanofab, or enzymatic biosynthesis. Biochem drugs and toxins only affect biomorphs.

**Nano:** Nanodrugs and -toxins are temporary nanobot colonies designed to operate within biological hosts and programmed to create a certain effect. Nanodrugs and -toxins only affect biomorphs.

**Electronic:** These reproduce drug-like effects for infomorphs and egos residing in cyberbrains. E-drugs are sold on the black market as single-use or self-erasing downloads, just like blueprints.

### Application Methods

The application method determines how quickly the substance is absorbed into the body, as noted on the Onset Times table. An onset time of _immediate_ means the effect kicks in at the end of an action turn, an onset time of _1 action turn_ kicks in at the end of the next turn.

<blockquote class="table">

### Onset Times

| Application Method |  Onset Time   |
| :----------------- | :-----------: |
| Dermal             | 1 action turn |
| Inhalation         |   Immediate   |
| Injection          | 1 action turn |
| Oral               |  15 minutes   |

</blockquote>

**App:** Electronic substances are run like other software.

**Dermal (D):** This drug/toxin is absorbed via the skin as either a gas, liquid, or solid (e.g., paste). Slap patches or splash weapons are commonly used, loaded with the chemical DMSO, which transfers the drug through the skin. Slap patches can be applied to others in melee combat with a touch-only (+20) attack. Melee weapons may also be coated ([Coated Weapons](../12/15-special-attacks.md#coated-weapons)).

**Inhalation (Inh):** This is a gas that is breathed into the lungs or snorted nasally. Used for inhalers, aerosols, powders, and gas grenades/seekers.

**Injected (Inj):** This liquid is applied via either an intramuscular or intravenous injection. Used for needles and piercing weapons ([Coated Weapons](../12/15-special-attacks.md#coated-weapons)).

**Oral (O):** This is a liquid or solid that is absorbed through the stomach or oral cavity (eating or drinking). Used with pills and liquids.

### Effects

If you are exposed to a drug or toxin via its method of application — for example, you pop a pill, slap on a dermal patch, are soaked with a splash grenade, breathe in gas, or get stabbed with a coated weapon — then you are automatically subject to the substance’s effects. The duration determines how long they last.

There is no resistance test to ignore a drug or toxin’s effects, but some may call for an aptitude check to determine the effect severity.

**Defensive Ware:** [Toxin filters](10-combat-augmentations.md) allow a SOM Check to ignore a biochem drug or toxin’s effects outright (they have no effect on nanodrugs or nanotoxins). If an effect calls for an aptitude check, toxin filters apply a +30 modifier. Both toxin filters and medichines will reduce the effects of a biochem drug or toxin (damage, modifiers, etc.) and duration by half; together they nullify the effects entirely. Nanophages reduce the effects/duration of nanodrugs and nanotoxins by half.

## Addiction and Abuse

If you over-use a drug, you may find yourself addicted to it. Drugs can be physically addictive (affecting the morph), mentally addictive (affecting the ego), or both. If the GM decides that you are overusing (such as more than once a day, or several times in a week), you must make a WIL Check modified by the drug’s Addiction Modifier. If you fail, you acquire the [Addiction (Level 1) negative trait](../04/28-traits.md#addiction). Once addicted, you must take the drug regularly (according to the trait level) or face withdrawal (−10 modifier per level). At the GM’s discretion, heavy or extended drug use may require you to make a WIL Check modified by the Addiction Modifier to avoid increasing your Addiction trait’s level. Drug abuse may also result in other physiological or psychological effects.

## Chemicals

Just a few of the chemicals with interesting uses in Eclipse Phase:

<!--sort-->

| CHEMICALS       | Comp/<wbr>GP | Description                                                                             |
| :-------------- | :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atropine        |    Min/1     | Antidote against nerve agents.                                                          |
| DMSO            |    Min/1     | Carries other chemicals through the skin.                                               |
| Liquid Thermite |   Mod/R/2    | Gel that burns, inflicting DV 3d10 + 10 \[27\] per turn for 3 turns.                    |
| NotWater        |    Min/1     | Liquid fire retardant that does not get things wet.                                     |
| Scrapper’s Gel  |    Min/1     | Gel that burns, inflicting DV 2d10 + 5 \[16\] per turn for 3 turns.                     |
| Slip            |    Min/1     | Frictionless liquid. REF Check to walk across, SOM Check to hold on to, −30 to grapple. |
| Tracker Dye     |    Min/1     | Visible at other wavelengths.                                                           |

<!--sort-->

**Atropine:** Though poisonous in large doses, atropine is an effective antidote against nerve agents like BTX<sup>2</sup> and Nervex. Atropine will negate the effect whether taken soon before or after exposure.

**DMSO:** This chemical acts as a carrier, allowing other chemicals to be absorbed through the skin. It allows any chemical, drug, or toxin to be applied dermally.

**Liquid Thermite:** Liquid thermite comes in a gel form that is easily applied under all environmental conditions (by the nature of its chemical reaction, thermite is oxygenated and will burn underwater or in space). It is ignited with an electric charge, burning at temperatures exceeding 2,500&nbsp;°C and melting through whatever it is touching. Liquid thermite inflicts DV 3d10 + 10 \[27\] per action turn to whatever it is touching for 3 turns. Armor is also melted, reduce the AV by damage taken. Treat damage as cumulative for determining wounds.

**NotWater:** NotWater is an effective liquid fire retardant that does not get objects wet, no matter how absorbent they are — it simply beads up and slides right off.

**Scrapper’s Gel:** This goo turns into a potent acid when given an electrical charge. It comes in a gel-like state and may be smeared like jelly under most environmental conditions, even in space. In acid form, scrapper’s gel inflicts DV 2d10 + 5 \[16\] per action turn to anything it touches for 3 turns, unless the material has been treated against acid. Armor is also melted, reduce the AV by damage taken. Treat damage as cumulative for determining wounds.

**Slip:** This liquid is almost entirely frictionless. When spread around an area (such as by hose or splash grenade), anyone attempting to walk or run on the affected surface must make a REF Check or fall down. Coated surfaces are extremely hard to grip, requiring a SOM Check to hang on to. Anyone attempting to grapple a slip-soaked character suffers a −30 modifier.

**Tracker Dye:** This liquid is colorless at normal light but recognizable under other pre-specified wavelengths (such as infrared or UV).

<!--sort-->

**Drive:** This nootropic speeds up left-right brain hemisphere communication, stimulates idea production, and improves concentration. +1 Insight pool for 8 hours.

**Fokus:** This drug enables hyper-focus and concentration. Acquire the Enhanced Behavior: Obsessive (Level 2) trait for the duration and reduce task action timeframes by 25%.

**Klar:** Klar boosts alertness and enhances clarity and perception. Users report a feeling of being “elevated” to a higher level. You receive +10 to Perceive and do not suffer distraction modifiers for 8 hours.

**Neem:** Neem is a mnemonic drug that works by “tagging” experiences and mental input with a set of unique sensations that contribute to the formation of state-based memories. Neem provides a +20 modifier to COG Checks to recall memories or information you learned while on neem. The drawback to neem is that memories accumulated under the drug’s influence have no emotional association.

<!--sort-->

**Aggro:** This drug stimulates a massive burst of aggression pheromones. This provides a +20 modifier when using Provoke to intimidate or taunt ([Social Attacks](../12/22-social-actions.md#social-attacks)), but a −20 modifier to all other social skill tests. These modifiers are only effective when dealing with biomorphs of the same species who can smell you.

**Brutalitea:** Often served as a delicious tea, this combat drug heightens endurance and injury tolerance. Increase your Durability by 5, Wound Threshold by 1, and Death Rating by 8 for 3 hours.

**Grin:** Grin is an effective opiate and pain suppressant. You ignore the modifiers from 1 wound (cumulative with other pain negation mods, to a maximum of 3 wounds).

**Kick:** Kick is a strong stimulant that boosts your reflexes and energy reserves. Increase your Vigor pool by 1 for 8 hours.

**MRDR:** MRDR is a brutal amphetamine that increases your pain tolerance, speed, and strength. Increase your Vigor pool by 2 and ignore one wound (cumulative with other pain negation mods, to a maximum of 3 wounds) for 1 hour. While under MRDR’s influence, you are twitchy and react in a jumpy, cat-like fashion to sudden or unexpected stimuli. Make a WIL Check or react without thinking to unexpected noises or other surprises. This drug also makes you a raging asshole; acquire the Enhanced Behavior: Aggression (Level 2) trait for the duration and suffer a −20 modifier to social skill tests.

**Phlo:** Phlo increases coordination and muscle control, making your movements smooth, graceful, and precise. +1 Vigor. Additionally, you can use Vigor pool twice on the same test if needed.

**Rev:** This stimulant boosts your endurance. You can take a short recharge with a complex action, rather than 10 minutes.

<!--sort-->

**Bananas Furiosas:** This drug reverses the effects of ionizing radiation on your body’s cells. It most commonly comes in bunches of bright orange-red bananas. Belters prefer the drug in cigarette form, for the irony. Bananas allow you to halve the damage and ignore impairment modifiers from radiation poisoning for 8 hours.

**Comfurt:** Commonly served as a tasty yogurt treat, comfurt blocks stress hormones, stabilizes mood, and relieves anxiety. Temporarily boost Lucidity by 5, Trauma Threshold by 1, and Insanity Rating by 5. Excessive use of comfurt can lead to chronic itchiness caused by histamine release.

## Nanodrugs

Nanodrugs are temporary nanobot infestations that apply a specific effect. They can make fundamental changes to a body’s biochemistry and mental state. GMs should consider including nanodrugs that temporarily apply certain traits, such as Direction Sense, Psi Chameleon, Psi Defense, Situational Awareness, or Superior Numeracy — experiment with different possibilities and effects!

<!--sort-->

| NANODRUGS | Type  | Application | Duration  | Addict Mod/<wbr>Type | Comp/<wbr>GP | Description                                                              |

**Freeq:** Originally called frequency, this drug was designed as a tool for scientific visualization. It releases nanobots into your bloodstream that settle in the epidermis, where they act as sensors for electromagnetic radiation. This sensory input is then injected into your visual and tactile sensoria as a sequence of novel stimuli, typically a light show or weird tactile sensations. Aside from its recreational uses, freeq is good at picking up on localized field radiation, allowing you to spot motes, sensors, and hidden electronics with a Perceive Test, depending on their range and signal strength (GM discretion).

**Gravy:** Gravy assists in acclimating to high-gravity environments. It is often added as a sauce to food and comes in a variety of flavors. For gravy to be 100% effective, you must begin using it at least 8 hours in advance. Reduce penalties for high-gravity acclimation by 20.

**Meds:** Also known as yào or healing potions, this temporary infusion of medical nanobots spurs recovery from injury for biomorphs. For 1 day, you heal 1d10 damage per hour. If all damage is removed, you instead heal 1 wound. Certain injuries (shattered bones, severed limbs) may require further medical care.

**Persona:** Persona manipulates your emotions, moods, and behaviors to change you into a different person. Each is focused on a different emotional state/behavior. For the duration, you acquire an [Enhanced Behavior (Level 2) trait](../04/28-traits.md#enhanced-behavior). Anyone using Kinesics to ID you suffers a −10 modifier.

**Retcon:** Retcon nanobots erase recently constructed memories. Your last 48 hours of memories are deleted. It is sometimes used offensively, though it has no effect on recorded XP, backups, or what your muse recalls. Due to the nature of biological memories, retcon is imperfect; some recent memories may be spared, some older ones may be wiped (GM discretion).

**Schizo:** Schizo mirrors the effects of paranoid schizophrenia. It is popular in socialite circles as a daring and intriguing experience. A dose of schizo commonly looks like a disposable antique razor blade. Making an incision in the skin releases a swarm of nanobots that travel to the central nervous system and induce the effects. Schizo makes you severely paranoid and hear voices. For the duration, you acquire the Mental Disorder: Schizophrenia trait (treat as Reiterative Schizophrenia) and Enhanced Behavior: Violent (Level 2) trait. When the drug wears off, suffer SV 1d10.

**Xsense:** Xsense nanobots engage in tissue engineering, building you a temporary new sensory organ. Most Xsense doses create non-human organs such as snake heat-sensing pits, the magnetic sense of birds, or stranger things derived from xenocritters. Variations on human organs are also possible: tri-cavity noses, eye stalks, or tympanik hearing membranes. These organs can manifest anywhere on your body after 4 hours, then are slowly reabsorbed afterwards. Most users prefer to keep the particular sense and location a surprise.

## Narcoalgorithms

Known colloquially as dopeware, narcos, and zapps, narcoalgorithms are programs that simulate the effects of drugs for infomorphs and egos in cyberbrains. Almost all biochem and nano drugs can be replicated as narcoalgorithms, with corresponding effect (GM discretion). Addiction to narcoalgorithms is considered mental, no matter the simulated drug. One positive side to narcoalgorithms is that the effect can be immediately stopped by pausing the app.

<!--sort-->

**DDR:** Originally distributed as a bot-targeting virus by prankster hackers, DDR (“Dance Dance Robot”) triggers impulses in your motor control circuits. The effect makes your shell “dance” in jerky, automated movements. Pleasure receptors are also activated so that dancing — and movement of any kind — feels fantastic. Variants invoke different motions and styles. While dancing, you suffer a −20 modifier to other actions. You can override the dancing with a WIL Check. Non-embodied infomorphs feel the need to dance, but are otherwise unaffected.

**Linkstate:** This app connects you via VPN to other linkstate users and samples their XP feed and randomly accessed memories — typically just enough to provide context, but not enough to acquire private personal details. These inputs are spliced together, their emotional inputs amplified, and the entire package spiked with hormonal circuit triggers and artificial synaesthesia. The effect is a mind-blowing mixed sampling of people’s lives, mashed together in a sensory soup that hits the mind with a euphoric rush. You are catatonic while under linkstate’s effects, but afterwards you may experience flashbacks of events in other people’s lives.

**Randomizer:** This app randomly triggers, intensifies, and suppresses neurotransmitter functions, with the effect of creating sudden and random mood swings. You may go from depressed to exuberant to pensive in a matter of minutes. Though the emotional roller coaster is draining to some, others find it thrilling or like the challenge of adapting to it. At any given time, you have a 50% chance of receiving a +10 modifier to social skill tests and a 50% chance of a −10 modifier.

## Petals

Petals are a narrative hallucinogen, a nanodrug that hijacks your senses and takes you on a game-like, highly immersive trip. They are post-Fall society’s heroin — the drug of choice for the desperate and fucked. Petals are made in the form of nanopharmaceutical flowers, potted or with a nutrient pack attached to the stem. Plucking and swallowing the petals from the flower triggers the effects. Each flower has 1d6 + 4 petals. Multiple users may share the experience if they take the petals within 1 minute of the first one being plucked; after this all petals remaining on the flower fade to translucent white and become inert.

Petal experiences are entire scenarios in and of themselves. Some access your mesh inserts (you must enable access to your implants voluntarily; if not, the drug has no effect other than low-intensity LSD-like visual hallucinations), take control of your entoptic displays, link to secretive mesh servers and other trippers, and invade your sensorium with AR “hallucinations.” Others put you into a near-comatose state during which you go on a head trip. Normally there is a well-developed theme or plot to a petal experience, though others are just streams of thematicallylinked images.

Though illegal and suppressed in many polities, new petals appear constantly, fueled by a persistent subculture of makers and users. Petalcrafters view their work as an art form. The best petals are lovingly designed, hauntingly beautiful experiences — or sometimes terrifying. The subculture of petal use ranges from casual users who occasionally do an easy, short-duration flower to hardcore addicts who spend any time not on petals trying to hunt down the most intense and esoteric varieties. Because petals combine custom nanobots with tailored chemical payloads and access codes to mesh servers, duplicating them using fabricators is impossible, leading to an active market of crafters, dealers, and traders.

Petals sometimes contain easter eggs and rewards, called “sweets” by petal users. Getting the sweets usually requires fulfilling certain conditions within the trip, such as correctly answering questions or reaching goals. Typical sweets include skillsofts, new clothing or product designs, and custom infomorph avatars.

On the negative side, some petal trips go bad, inflicting SV 1d10 or worse. Some petals are also loaded with malware that invades your mesh inserts and exploits your data and accounts while you are high. Firewall has even heard accounts of petals carrying strains of the exsurgent virus.

**Inquisitive Green:** Things of a certain color (often green, but not always) take on a life of their own. The color itself has achieved sapience and seeks to learn of the universe. It enlists your aid, at first. Other trippers meet and work with other colors. Eventually, it learns to spread its color to other things, taking control. Other colors conspire against it. Do you choose sides or find a way for the colors to cooperate and live in harmony? Then, the White comes. All colors fear the White.

**Soul Stave:** This petal discreetly copies forks of your ego. You find yourself in a magical realm, full of dangerous monsters and powerful magic items. The items are all possessed by intelligent spirits — embodied forks of other trippers. Strange ethereal creatures provide you with quests. Ultimately, you seek to acquire the items that contain your forks — and the ritual that will re-merge them. But one fork has fallen into the clutches of an evil wizard, whose dark staff consumes all spirits. Rumors suggest that there are many levels to this petal experience and that you can only defeat the wizard by learning their dark power and consuming spirits into yourself.

**The Creeps:** You experience phantom limb — for a limb you’ve never had. This missing part moves and feels, but you cannot see it. It finds some things/people/places pleasing, others repulsive. You feel it attempting to grasp, write, and manipulate. You see new limbs on other trippers, which they cannot sense. They describe limbs on you, which you neither sense nor feel. You can exchange limbs with each other to try them out, but they’re usually not your missing limb. To find your ghost limb, you must explore it’s invisible desires. The new limbs you try have minds of their own and may mislead you.

## Psi Drugs

Research into the Watts-MacLeod strain has resulted in several exceptional breakthroughs with psi-impacting drugs. Each of these drugs is in the experimental stage, but they are already finding some use among Firewall and similar secretive groupings.

<!--sort-->

**Inhibitor:** Inhibitor is a cocktail of neurochemicals that block some brain receptor and transmitter functions in an attempt to reduce psi-waves and block or impair sleights. This drug is commonly used to restrain async prisoners from using their abilities. Make a WIL Check at −20. If you fail, lose all psi abilities for the drug’s duration. If you succeed, you still suffer a −30 modifier to Psi Tests. Inhibitor-influenced characters have a glazed, dopey expression and difficulty getting excited or emotional.

**Psi-Opener:** Psi-opener drugs are variants of the Watts-MacLeod strain with a temporary effect and that do not permanently alter the user’s brain. Psi-opener temporarily gives you the effect of one particular psi-chi sleight; each type of psi-opener is customized for a particular sleight. However, users are frequently subject to hallucinations (GM discretion). When the drug wears off, suffer SV 1d6.

<!--sort-union-->

**Psi-Kick:** Psi-kick functions like psi-opener, except it mimics the function of a specific psi-gamma sleight. It also boosts your latent psychic ability. Non-asyncs lacking Psi skill can default to WIL × 2. For this reason, psi-kick is often doubled up with psike-out. Using psi-kick is a mind-wrenching experience. Take SV 1d10 + 2 after the drug wears off.

**Psike-Out:** Psike-out bolsters an async’s psi abilities. Apply a +10 modifier to Psi skill tests for the drug’s duration.

**Buzz:** This gene-modified variant of BZ is an odorless, invisible, powerful hallucinogen. For its duration, you undergo extremely realistic hallucinations. Your hallucinations are susceptible to suggestion by others (−30 to SAV/WIL Checks to oppose Persuade or Provoke); users often “share” described hallucinations with each other. Afterwards, you suffer a −30&nbsp;COG Check modifier to remember what occurred while under the influence.

**Mono No Aware:** Named for the Japanese term for sadness at the ephemerality of worldly things, this drug, typically ingested as a tea, is a depressant that induces a meditative state. Mono no aware provides a +10 modifier to Art skills. With frequent use, mono no aware reacts with pigments in the skin to create a pallor with a slight bluish tinge, even in darker-skinned morphs.

**Orbital Hash:** Mr. H is marijuana grown in space using powerful lighting and advanced hydroponics. Because space is at a premium in habitats and scum barges, blocks of hashish are the preferred mode of transport and delivery. However, for the wealthy and on planets, buds in leaf form are not uncommon. While high, you ignore the effects of 1 trauma, but suffer a −10 penalty to Know Tests and memory-related COG Checks. Hash users exhibit bloodshot eyes, lethargic behaviors, and the munchies.

**TGS:** The good stuff is gene-modified orbital hash, providing greater benefits with fewer side effects. Ignore the effects of 1 trauma and 1 wound, receive a +10&nbsp;WIL Check modifier, and acquire the Enhanced Behavior: Serene (Level 2) trait.

<!--sort-->

**Blab:** Blab impedes your ability to lie or withhold information. You suffer a −30&nbsp;SAV/WIL Check modifier against Persuade and Provoke Tests made to interrogate or extract information. You also suffer −30 to Deceive Tests. For the duration, you acquire the Neural Damage: Logorrhea trait, making you excessively talkative.

**Hither:** Want to ooze sexy like a pleasure morph on a hot tin habitat? For those desiring that slinky je-ne-sais-quoi, hither is the tool. Hither typically comes as a clear, slippery gel with a musky, floral scent that is applied to parts of the body with large concentrations of sweat glands. It is a mild euphoriant, imparting a feeling of confidence and you-know-you-want-it-ness to the user. It also stimulates abundant production of lust pheromones. You gain a +10 bonus on Provoke Tests to seduce against biomorphs of the same species who can smell you. You also gain the Enhanced Behavior: Aroused (Level 2) trait for the duration.

**Juice:** This potent anti-depressant makes it almost impossible to have bad feelings or negative thoughts. You are unnaturally happy and positive — often irritatingly or strangely so. You receive a +30 modifier to SAV/WIL Checks against fear or attempts to manipulate your emotions in a negative direction. You gain the Enhanced Behavior: Happy (Level 3) trait. Under juice’s influence, you may act inappropriately, like giggling over the massive amount of spilled blood or cheerfully changing the subject to inane topics when someone else is freaking out.

**Nofux:** This drug lowers inhibitions and heightens determination. Nofux users know what they want and are resolved to get their way. Gain 1 Moxie pool for the duration.

**BTX<sup>2</sup>:** Also called “frog bite,” BTX<sup>2</sup> is a genetically enhanced variant of batrachotoxin, an extremely potent cardiotoxin and neurotoxin. It leads to fast paralysis and cardiac arrest that usually kills the target within a few action turns. Affected characters suffer DV 2d10 + 10 for 3 action turns; medichines reduce this damage by half. You must also make a SOM Check or be immobilized for 1 hour.

**CR Gas:** This potent incapacitating agent causes eye twitching and temporary blindness, severe coughing and breathing difficulty, skin irritation, and panic. Affected characters suffer DV 1d6, a −30 modifier to sight-based Perceive Tests, and a −20 impairment modifier to all other actions for 20 minutes.

**Flight:** This drug is derived from pheromones released due to fear and is intended to instill alarm or even terror. Make a WIL Check or suffer a panic attack, inflicting SV 1d10. You also suffer a −30 modifier for resisting intimidation or fear-based emotional manipulations for 1 hour.

**Nervex:** Derived from deadly nerve agents like cyclosarin, VX, and novichok, this genetically modified toxin is deployed as a colorless, odorless gas that turns safely inert 10 minutes after deployment. It causes involuntary contraction of the muscles, seizures, and death by respiratory failure. You suffer a −20 modifier to all actions and must make a SOM Check or be incapacitated by seizures, paralysis, nausea, and vomiting. After 10 minutes, you will die unless an antidote (such as [atropine](#chemicals)) is applied.

**Oxytocin-A:** A genetically improved variant of oxytocin, this drug induces trust. Apply a −30 modifier to WIL Checks and Kinesics Tests where trust is a factor.

**Twitch:** Twitch is a convulsive agent, a nonlethal nerve gas. Apply a −20 modifier to all actions and make a SOM Check or become incapacitated with severe muscle tremors for 10 minutes.

<!--sort-->

**Disruptor:** This nanotoxin attacks the myelin sheath on nerves, disrupting nerve impulses and inflicting symptoms of multiple sclerosis (impaired vision, muscle strength, and coordination). Every hour, you suffer a cumulative −5 modifier to all actions. If the total modifier meets or exceeds your Durability, you are paralyzed and catatonic (incapacitated). These modifiers can only be reduced with regenerative time in a healing vat (1 hour per −5).

**Necrosis:** Necrosis nanobots attack the walls of cells inside the body, killing tissue. This nanotoxin inflicts DV 1d6 per action turn for one minute, after which the nanobots disable and flush from the body.

**Neuropath:** These nanobots stimulate pain receptors on a systemic level, inflicting agony. Suffer −30 to all actions from the inflicted agony and make a WIL Check or become incapacitated for 8 hours. Anything that allows you to ignore wound modifiers can be used to reduce the pain modifier by 10.

**Nutcracker:** Nutcrackers are nanobots designed to locate your cortical stack and disassemble the diamond lattice. This process takes approximately 6 hours, after which the cortical stack is destroyed. These nanobots also attack the cortical stack’s connections to the (cyber)brain and brain-mapping nanobots. After 1 hour, you will be aware that your cortical stack and neural lace are suffering damage. After 3 hours, all connections will be severed and the cortical stack will no longer record backups.
