Credit and mutual aid can get you many things in Eclipse Phase.

**Anonymizer:** You have an account with an anonymizing proxy service that masks your [Mesh ID](../13/05-authentication-and-encryption.md#mesh-id).

**Private Sensor Feed:** Each private sensor feed covers an area equivalent to a neighborhood or small habitat. Using it provides a +10 bonus to Perceive Tests when surveiling that area.

**Private Server:** Capable of running simulspace and 50 infomorphs.

**Private Server Partition:** Home space for an infomorph on a protected cloud server.

**Simulspace:** You have access to a virtual game environment, private meeting space, interactive media service, unreal vacation library, or other simulspace environment.

**Bot/Vehicle Rental:** In some locations, bots and vehicles can be rented on a weekly basis, though you are liable for damages/replacement. The GM determines availability.

**Dead Zone Map:** This map shows areas in a neighborhood or small habitat that lack public and/or private surveillance coverage.

**Egocasting:** This is the use of a ship or habitat’s farcaster to transmit an ego/infomorph. Farcasting is not cheap, and the cost is impacted by factors such as distance to receiver station and priority service (paying extra to get bumped ahead in line).

**Fake Ego ID:** This forged ID will pass in most inner system and Jovian Republic habitats, and sometimes others. It gives you a rep score in one network with that ID at 10.

**Healing Service:** A day in a healing vat can be used for wound recovery or elective surgery ([Healing & Repair](../12/17-healing-and-repair.md)).

**License:** You acquire a license to carry a weapon or perform some other restricted activity. Requires an ID/background check.

**Morph Storage:** Your biomorph is kept on ice for a week or your synthmorph securely stored, without being rented out to others.

**Privacy Suite:** Per hour privacy suite services are offered by many restaurants, night clubs, hotels, and similar businesses who frequently have clientèle that desire a private space for meetings or other functions.

**Professional Service:** You may need to seek the services of a skilled professional. This can include anything from weapons repair, bodyguarding, or scientific analysis to ripping a surveillance dead zone or hacking a database.

**Psychosurgery:** An hour long (subjectively longer with time acceleration) psychosurgery session in an immersive high-fidelity simulspace can help you recover from mental stress and trauma ([Mental Healing & Psychosurgery](../12/19-mental-healing-and-psychosurgery.md)).

**Recovery Bond:** In the event of your death or disappearance, an agent of the insurer will personally seek to recover your cortical stack using all safe and legal methods at their disposal. This includes negotiating with rival polities, paying ransoms, sponsoring search teams, etc.

**Recovery Bond (Hazardous):** As a regular bond, except that a team of agents will seek out your stack even against adverse and hostile conditions, including infiltrating war zones and running rescue ops on unknown exoplanets. This may include stealing the stack back from hostile parties.

**Space Travel:** Space transport cost depends on a number of factors like distance, quality of lodgings, and how much cargo you’re bringing with. At the low end, an intra-habitat shuttle trip within the same cluster, or a trip to or from a planetary body’s surface and orbit, is not cheap but affordable. Just about anything else is progressively more costly.
