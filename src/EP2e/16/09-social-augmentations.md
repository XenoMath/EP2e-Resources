**Bodysculpting:** Customizing your looks is easy. Elongated ears or fingers, nose alteration, hair addition/removal, feathers, exotic eyes, snakeskin, endowed genitalia, enlarged canines, whiskers, eyestalks, fur, frills, scarification, piercings, skin dyes, and stranger things are common sights on many habitats. Subdermal implants can create bumps, ridges, piercing anchors, and similar textures and alterations. Synthmorphs get in on the fun too, with stylized chassis, oddly shaped heads, exposed interiors, sculpted frames, lights, sound systems, and other after-market mods.

**Chameleon Skin:** The morph’s skin is augmented with complex chromatophores so that it changes color like a chameleon or octopus. Your morph can match the appearance of almost any color and most patterns. Apply a +10 modifier to Infiltrate Tests, +30 if stationary and either nude or wearing smart clothing with the same color/pattern. This camo does not apply against radar, x-ray, gamma-ray, or infrared heat sensors (including enhanced vision). Alternatively, you can deliberately stand out (+10 to +30 to Perceive Tests to notice) or simply look sharp.

**Clean Metabolism:** The morph’s symbiotic bacteria, gut flora, and glands are genetically engineered to keep the morph “clean.” The morph also produces smart antibiotics that prevent the growth of any bacteria or yeasts in it or on its skin. As a result, your morph is completely immune to infections, dental cavities, and bad breath, its sweat has no scent, and the morph’s efficient digestion produces somewhat less solid waste and less odorous chemicals.

**Endocrine Control:** This modifies the morph’s endocrine system (or the software sim of it), giving you a measure of control over your hormones. You can influence your appetite, thirst and remain awake for 48 hours without penalty. You also have fine control over your emotional states, and can “gland” happiness, sadness, aggression, arousal, trust, suspicion, and so on. Increase your Moxie pool by 2.

**Enhanced Pheromones:** The morph’s biochemistry produces tailored and synthetic pheromonal signals that subconsciously affect the behavior of other biomorphs of the same species. These pheromones influence others that can smell you to treat you warmly and with trust. Apply a +10 modifier to Persuade and Provoke Tests. This augmentation has no effect on non-biomorphs or other species.

**Nanotats:** Your skin/shell is an artistic canvas. Tattoos created with nanobots can move around the body, change shape, color, brightness, texture, alternate text and images, and/or even create minor holographic effects on the skin’s surface, controllable via mesh inserts.

**Neuromodulation:** This nanoware system enables you to influence your brain’s neurotransmitters. This gives you rough control over your emotional states (much like endocrine control), though to a lesser degree. Increase your Moxie pool by 1.

**Scent Alteration:** Minor changes to a body’s biochemistry can alter your natural smell. You can sweat vanilla, taste like oranges, or leave a waft of sandalwood wherever you go. Or you can take a nod from the scum and secrete the iron tang of blood, the metallic scent of rust, or a particular xenocritter musk.

**Sex Switch:** A complex suite of alterations allows you to switch your physical sex to male, female, intersex, or neuter. This change is mentally triggered but takes approximately 1 week to complete.

**Skinflex:** This disguise implant allows you to restructure your facial features and musculature and alter skin tone and hair color. This process takes 1d6 minutes. Skinflex adds +30 to Exotic Skill: Disguise or Deceive Tests for disguise or impersonation.

**Synthetic Cover:** A synthetic mask, but for cyberlimbs.

**Synthetic Mask:** Your shell is equipped with a realistic faux-skin casing and carefully sculpted to pass as a biomorph (perhaps even a particular person). The morph can cry, spit, have sex, and will even bleed if cut. Only a detailed physical examination at −30 or a radar or x-ray scan will detect the synthmorph’s true nature. If disguised as a particular person, apply a +30 modifier to disguise-based Deceive or Exotic Skill: Disguise Tests.
