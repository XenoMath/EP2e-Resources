# Thrown Weapons

Aside from grenades ([Seeker Weapons & Grenades](10-seeker-weapons-and-grenades.md)), few throwing weapons are commonly used in Eclipse Phase. Use Athletics skill when throwing items to strike with an impact, such as a baseball or dart, or to center an area effect, like a grenade. Use an appropriate Exotic skill for weapons that require more finesse or special techniques, such as throwing knives, axes, or shuriken.

All thrown weapons have a range of SOM in meters.
