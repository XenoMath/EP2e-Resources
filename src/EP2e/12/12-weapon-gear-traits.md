# Weapon/Gear Traits

A number of weapons and some gear items list specific traits that indicate special effects. Some of these inflict specific [conditions](21-other-action-factors.md#conditions) on the target:

<!--sort-->

- **Armor-Piercing:** This weapon penetrates armor. The attack inflicts −1d10&nbsp;DV, but armor is halved. Weapons and ammo types listed as armor-piercing already incorporate the DV modifier. Additional armor-piercing effects are ignored.
- **Blinding:** Targets must make a REF Check or be [blinded](21-other-action-factors.md#conditions) for 1 action turns, +1 per superior failure. A critical failure results in permanent blindness until repaired or they spend time in a healing vat. Anti-glare ware protects against blinding based on light.
- **Concealable:** This item is easily hidden. You receive a +30 to Infiltrate Tests to hide this item on your person (or elsewhere).
- **Entangling:** Targets struck by this weapon must make a REF Check or be [grappled](02-melee-combat.md#grappling). The attacker’s superior successes apply a cumulative −10 to this REF Check and SOM Checks to break free.
- **Fixed:** Fixed weapons are designed to be fired from a prone or braced position, such as mounted on a bipod or hardpoint. If carried, apply a −20 modifier to attacks and consider them to have the Two-Handed trait.
- **Fragile:** This items breaks or becomes unusable if you roll a superior failure.
- **Knockdown:** This strike may knock even unwounded opponents off their feet. The target must make a SOM Check or be knocked prone.
- **Lacks Smartlink:** This weapon is not equipped with a smartlink’s targeting assistance. −10 to attack tests.
- **Long:** Lengthy weapons are unwieldy in close combat (−30 to fire when in melee) and do not receive the +10 modifier when fired at Point-Blank range.
- **No Close:** This weapon cannot be fired at Point-Blank or Close range. Seeker weapons have built-in safety features that prevent them from being fired at ranges that might injure the user. Overriding this features requires a Hardware or Infosec Test.
- **No Point-Blank:** This weapon cannot be fired at Point-Blank range.
- **Pain:** A biomorph target struck by this weapon must make a WIL Check or take their next full action to flee, moving as far away from the pain-inflicting source as possible or to the nearest full cover they can reach on their action. Targets also suffer −20 until the end of the next turn. Targets with the Pain Tolerance (Level 1) trait receive a +30 to their WIL Check and only suffer a −10 modifier. Targets with Pain Tolerance (Level 2) are immune to this effect. Victims who are trapped in the beam or otherwise cannot avoid the pain effect are impaired (−20) until they escape.
- **Shock:** This weapon inflicts a [shock effect](15-special-attacks.md#shock-attacks).
- **Single-Use:** This item can only be used once.
- **Steady:** This weapon ignores range modifiers.
- **Stun:** Targets must make a SOM Check or be [stunned](21-other-action-factors.md#conditions) for 1 action turn, +1 per superior failure. Apply kinetic armor as a positive modifier. Large targets receive a +30, small targets receive a −30 modifier. On a critical failure, they are incapacitated for 1 action turn and stunned for 1 minute.
- **Touch-Only:** This melee attack just requires a touch. +20 to hit, but no DV is inflicted ([Touch-Only Attacks](02-melee-combat.md#touch-only-attacks)).
- **Two-Handed:** This weapon requires two hands (or an equivalent prehensile limb) to use. Apply a −20 modifier to attack if used single-handed.
