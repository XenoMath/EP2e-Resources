# Weapon Systems

Spaceship weapons, habitat defense systems, emplaced turrets: all such weapon systems are fired using Interface skill. These types of weapons are invariably controlled through meshed computer interfaces. The attacker relies on the weaponâ€™s sensor feeds, tactical display, and skill rather than any physical action. For this reason, Insight pool applies to tests when using weapon systems, not Vigor.

Many weapon systems use portable weapons that are emplaced or physically hardwired to a turret or similar hardpoint. Others are significantly larger weapon systems, designed for taking out ships and military vehicles. The rules and stats for these systems are beyond the scope of this book, but as a general guideline they will have ranges and Damage Values double that of portable weapons.
