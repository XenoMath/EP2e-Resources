# Vehicle Movement

The [Movement Rate rules](24-movement.md#movement-rate) apply to tactical combat and interactions between characters, bots, and other entities. Most shells, however, have mobility systems that allow for much greater speeds. The following rules apply to these situations.

## Control

Moving at vehicle speeds in a controlled manner requires a quick action every action turn to maintain. You may choose not to take this action and still maintain velocity or coast, but you cannot make Fray Tests that turn and suffer a −30 modifier to any Athletics, Free Fall, or Pilot Tests that are called for that turn.

## Chases

Chases are handled as opposed tests, applying appropriate modifiers for terrain, weather, navigation, pedestrians, traffic, and other environmental conditions. For narrative purposes, we recommend breaking a chase down into several segments, each with their own maneuvering choices and tests, enabling the pursuer and pursued to gain or eliminate temporary advantages over each other.

## Crashes

Not every failed Athletics or Pilot roll should result in a crash. In most cases, it simply means you failed to accomplish what you were trying to do. You take the wrong route, get lost, realize you don’t have enough speed to make the jump and turn away, don’t make a sharp turn in time and simply pass by, or simply skid to a stop. Superior failures mean the outcome is worse, potentially putting you at a disadvantage. Critical failures, however, should result in a crash, breakdown, or similar negative effect. Of course, the GM may put you in a situation where a failure to make a roll results in a crash, period.

### Collisions

A crash may result in damage to the shell (and any occupants). Likewise, if a shell crashes into or intentionally rams a person or object, someone is likely to get hurt. The Collisions table indicates the DV inflicted. If the shell strikes something equally dense and hard, both take damage. If the shell strikes something soft and squishy, like a biomorph, the shell only takes half damage. Kinetic armor protects against crash damage.

If two moving shells collide head-on, calculate the damage from both and inflict to both. If two shells moving in the same direction collide, only count the difference in velocity.

Passengers in a shell may also be damaged by collisions if they are not wearing proper safety restraints. They suffer one half the DV applied to their shell (less their own kinetic armor).

### Collisions

**Base DV:** 1d10 + (DUR ÷ 10)

| Shell Speed     | DV                                           |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Up to Base Move | Base DV                                      |
| Above Base Move | Base DV × (velocity ÷ 10 in meters per turn) |

## Attacking Passengers

You can target passengers within a shell separately from the vehicle itself. If targeting through an unarmored window or open space, the attack does not damage the shell (unless an area effect weapon is used), but the passenger may benefit from cover (−10 to −30). If targeting through the shell, cover modifiers apply, the passenger adds the shell’s armor to their own, and the shell itself takes half damage (unless the attack is area effect).
