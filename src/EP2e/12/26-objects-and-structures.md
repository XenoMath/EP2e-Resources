# Objects & Structures

Inanimate objects have their own Destruction Rating, Wound Threshold, and Armor Value scores, just like characters. Destruction Rating measures how much damage the item or structure can take before it is destroyed.

GMs should exercise their judgment when determining the effects of wounds on objects. Wounded mechanical devices and electronics may function less effectively and inflict a negative modifier on skill tests (a cumulative −10 per wound). Particularly sensitive electronics may cease functioning after one wound. Simpler objects and structures reflect wounds as large holes (roughly 0.5 meters diameter), partial demolition, or impaired function.

For large objects/structures, treat individual components as separate entities when inflicting damage.

## Ranged Attacks

Ranged kinetic attacks such as bullets tend to inflict only minor damage on large structures such as doors, walls, etc., as the projectiles simply pass through. Reduce their damage after armor is applied by half. Area-effect weapons inflicting kinetic damage — such as frag grenades — affect structures normally.

Likewise, beam and energy weapons do full damage against objects and structures and may even set flammable materials on fire. Agonizers and stunners have no effect on objects and structures, however, unless fired at the same spot for a very long time.

## Shooting Through an Object

Attacks made through an item or structure at a target on the other side suffer cover, blind fire, or indirect fire modifiers, depending on whether you can see part of the target, can’t see them at all, or are using a spotter. Additionally, the target receives an armor bonus equal to the object/structure’s Armor Value. The object/structure itself is also damaged by the attack, as indicated above. Note that agonizers and stunners are not penetrating enough to fire through objects.

## Making Objects

Creating an item from scratch is handled as a task action with a timeframe determined by the GM. The timeframe should be set according to the complexity of the object and could range from an hour (constructing a set of shelves) to days (assembling a robot from spare parts) or even months (building a house). Numerous factors may apply modifiers to the test, such as the use of entoptic blueprints/help manuals (+10) or poor working conditions (−10 to −30). Tools are also a factor, perhaps making the job easier (superior tools +10 to +30), more difficult (poor or inadequate tools, −10 to −30), or even impossible (lack of required tools).

For rules on nanofabricating objects, see [Acquiring Gear](../16/02-acquiring-gear.md).

## Repairing Objects

Damaged items can be repaired, see [Synthmorph/Object Repair](17-healing-and-repair.md#synthmorphobject-repair).

## Modifying Objects

Altering an object’s design and function follows the same basic rules as build and repair, above. The timeframe is determined by the GM as appropriate to the modification.
