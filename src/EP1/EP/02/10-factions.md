# Factions

One would have thought a cataclysmic event such
as the Fall would bring the surviving elements of
transhumanity closer together, jointly dedicating
themselves to the repopulation of the solar system
and continued prosperity. Instead, the remoteness
and physical isolation of transhuman colonies and
habitats stretched across the solar system, as well as
the effects emerging technologies have had on transhuman
economies and social lives, have promoted
the evolution of a wide spectrum of philosophies,
agendas, and political models.

## THE HYPERCORPS

To some economists, the Fall and the numerous
crises that predated it on Earth can be viewed as an
extinction event, the end of the line for the massive
transnational megacorp dinosaurs, financial giants
that supported their monolithic frameworks on out-
dated economic models and industrial technologies.
The hypercorps are their evolutionary descendants:
slimmer, faster, meaner, and more flexible eagerly
embracing the possibilities of new technologies and
never afraid to toss the old aside to take advantage
of the new. It was the hypercorps that drove transhumanity’s
expansion into space and who continue to
push the technological envelope, guiding transhumanity
towards new horizons—always with profit as their
driving goal.

Most hypercorps are decentralized, non-asset-based
legal entities. Complete automation, advanced robotics,
morph technology, and cornucopia machines
allow the hypercorps to abstain from mass employment
for labor or production services. The need for
physical labor has mostly been reduced to tasks
associated with habitat construction, terraforming, or
deep space mining. Infomorphs and AIs are heavily
employed (or more accurately, owned) as drone
operators or virtual workers, and many administrative
tasks are performed online via augmented reality,
virtual private networks, and simulspace nodes. Some
hypercorps are in fact entirely “virtual,” with no
physical assets and each employee acting as a mobile
office A few major hypercorps literally consist of only
a dozen transhuman personnel. Though some hypercorps
are massive and diversified most specialize in
particular fields or services. This results in both an
intricate system of partnerships to develop, produce,
and market products and services and a large-scale
tendency to internally contract special services from
other hypercorps. Many hypercorps also pool their
resources and talent into cooperative research initiatives,
project centers, or shared habitats.

Most hypercorps are traditional capitalist in
outlook, though many have adopted alternative
business philosophies and management models. This
might include basing decisions on internal forecast
market trends, groupthink consensus models, or
ditching management entirely in favor of staff 
polling/voting initiatives that statistically fare better. A few
are anarcho-capitalist or mutualist companies originating
from Extropian enclaves, though these often
suffer from a bias when making deals with inner
system powers. 

The solar system boasts thousands of hypercorps;
a few of the more prominent and interesting are
noted below.

### COGNITE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Cognitive Science, Mental Implants, Psychosurgery, Nootropics
- **Major Stations:** Thought (Venus orbit), Phobos (Mars moon)

</div>

A pioneer in the fi ld of cognitive science, Cognite
(pronounced cog-neet) drives forward the cutting edge
of research into understanding the transhuman mind.
Well known for their mental augmentations and the
original menton morph design, Cognite also specializes
in psychosurgery and nootropics. Their elitist
and aloof image was not aided by their scandalous
involvement with the projects to raise accelerated
growth children that became known as the 
[Lost generation](../07/03-psychosurgery.md#the-lost),
nor rumors that they engage in
research involving TITAN-influenced incapacitating
input attacks. Nevertheless they remain a key member
in the Planetary Consortium.




<blockquote>

### PSICLONE

<div class="stat-list">

- **To:** Poxy-99
- **From:** \<Encrypted\>

</div>

I’m enclosing some data I recently
acquired from an inside source regard-
ing a so-called “Project Psiclone”—some
type of black budget research
initiative pursued by Cognite, possibly
with involvement from other Planetary
Consortium interests. Their work seems
to focus strongly on the Watts-MacLeod
strain of the exsurgent virus—with
some alarming results.

</blockquote>

### COMET EXPRESS (COMEX)

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Courier Services, Shipping, Logistics
- **Major Stations:** Nectar (Luna), Olympus (Mars)

</div>

Comet Express specializes in delivery services,
interstellar logistics, supply chains, and shipping. They
maintain a presence on almost every transhuman
habitat in the solar system, often via local subcontractors.
Despite the wonders of nanofabrication, many
resources must still be imported. ComEx focuses on
managing supply and trade routes and making sure
physical shipments reach their destinations. For that
purpose, ComEx maintains orbital hubs equipped
with slingshot accelerators at strategic waypoints
throughout the system and a fleet of cargo vessels
and courier drones. For reasons unknown to the
public, ComEx is viewed with hostility by the Jovian
Republic, who have standing orders to shoot down
ComEx vessels.


### DIRECT ACTION

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Security Services, Military Contracting
- **Major Stations:** Hexagon (Earth-Luna L5)

</div>

Descended from the remnants of several pre-Fall
national military forces and private military contractors,
this hypercorp made a name for itself in the
period immediately following the Fall, where they
helped manage refugee populations among various
habitats and vessels while shattering any sign of
unrest immediately and with full force. Direct Action
today is known for its highly efficient shock troops
and superior combat morphs, providing security and
public police services to self-governing habitats or
hypercorp installations. Shifting political alliances
between habitat clusters, corporate rivalry, and the
constant fear of TITAN agents cater to Direct Action’s
paranoia-inducing marketing. The corporation maintains
several habitats as physical training facilities and
armament depots.

<blockquote>

### WAR CRIMES

<div class="stat-list">

- **To:** MeshLeaks Newswire
- **From:** \<mesh ID does not exist\>

</div>

You asked for it: <ins>verifiable evidence
proving Direct Action’s war crimes during
the Fall</ins> \<link failure\>. Go ahead, take it
public. The Planetary Consortium elites
will find you, kill you, and erase your
backups. Go ahead. Test them.

</blockquote>



### ECOLOGENE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Environmental Systems, Genetics
- **Major Stations:** McClintock (Mars orbit)

Ecologene specializes in living systems, environmental
genetics (with a specialty in insects), smart animals,
bioarchitecture, and environmental nanotech. They
design and maintain the ecosystems inside numerous
habitats and tunnel colonies. One of Ecologene’s
notable projects is building and maintaining a massive
genetics archive of all life forms, though this endeavor
was nearly crippled by the Fall. For unknown reasons,
Ecologene seems to be favored by the Factors. Some
speculate that Ecologene has some sort of blackmail
material in hand, while others believe Ecologene
is trading away transhumanity’s genetic secrets in
exchange for a few xeno-tech gifts.

</div>



### EXOTECH

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Uploading, AIs, Electronics, Software
- **Major Stations:**  Starwell (Main Belt)

</div>

Often regarded as the personal technocratic pulpit of
the infamous media mogul Morgan Sterling, Exotech
emerged from the Fall almost unscathed, any significant
losses absorbed by corporate assets in peripheral
market segments, while ruthlessly buying out troubled
competitors or think tanks unable to adapt to the
transitioning economy. Nowadays, Exotech remains
a predominant designer of high-end electronics, AIs,
and mesh presence software systems. ExoTech also
continues to pursue an uncompromising progressive
agenda with its research in mind emulation, uploading,
and resleeving, as well as infomorph ego simulation.
Rumors persist that ExoTech continues to carry out
research and even production of AGIs.

### EXPERIA

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Media (AR, VR, XP), News, Entertainment, Memetics
- **Major Stations:** Elysium (Mars)

</div>

Living up to its name, Experia dominates the solar
system’s news, media, and entertainment market segments,
generating controversy not only with its publicly
expressed pro-AI stance or inviting an AGI to its
board of directors, but also by proficient use of hyperviral
marketing and sophisticated XP-programming.
Another core segment is the production of educational
XP and infomorph or AI tutors, some of the
latter regularly ascending to pop-culture icon status.
Experia is the Planetary Consortium’s prime authority
on designing and deploying customized viral memes,
developed to counter anything posing a threat to
the Consortium’s interests. The corp has automated
nodes and VR centers on many habitats throughout
the solar system, and it contracts thousands of freelance
lifeloggers as live, roving, citizen journalistas.
Claims by some infomorphs that Experia has illegally
subjected indentured infomorphs to never-ending
simulation experiments for forecasting and intelligence
analysis purposes remain unsubstantiated.


### FA JING

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Mining, Energy, Biotech, Industrial Manufacturing
- **Major Stations:** New Dazhai (Mars)

</div>

The industrial giant Fa Jing is a powerhouse in the
mining and energy production markets and also
boasts a remarkable presence in the fields of biotech
and industrial equipment manufacturing. The former
megacorp has quickly adapted to the new economic
environments and reputation-based systems, thanks
partly to its dedication to network building and sharing
social responsibility, epitomized in concepts like *dàtóng*
and *guanxi*. Often considered insular and close-minded,
its internal communal and protective mindset is a
strong contrast to its manipulative and monopolist
business attitude. Fa Jing is engaged in mining operations
throughout the asteroid belt and the Trojans and
maintains significant corporate assets on Mars.


### GATEKEEPER CORPORATION

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Gatecrashing, Research, XP Media, Exoplanet Colonization
- **Major Stations:** Gateway (Pandora)

</div>

Initially born from the merger of several scientifi
institutions and their corporate financiers, this
hypercorp made a name for itself overnight when it
announced the successful decoding of the wormhole
gateway discovered on Saturn’s moon Pandora. Under
the leadership of the eccentric but charismatic
xeno-archeologist Xander Rabin, the consortium funds
gatecrasher explorations through the Pandora Gate,
paying a small share of the revenue to the explorers
but otherwise retaining all-encompassing rights on
any discoveries made—as well as the marketing and
distribution of the highly popular gatecrasher XP
recordings. Aside from scheduled explorations, the
consortium offers high-risk gatecrasher scouting and
discovery trips for the bold or desperate, selected
through a random lottery system.



### GO-NIN GROUP

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Banking, Agritech, Robotics, Services
- **Major Stations:** Tsukomo (Luna)

</div>

Considered a relic of Earth’s capitalist market economy,
the Go-nin Group is a traditional Japanese keiretsu, a
conglomerate of companies with interwoven relationships
and shareholdings, horizontally integrated across
several industries (and sometimes vertically integrated
within a business sector as well), and centered around
the long-lived Tamahashi enterprise consultancy firm
Tamahashi evolved from an influential corporate lobby
to a diversified bank holding major equity in the group’s
partners; it now controls the group’s assets and directs
the partnership’s overall business strategy. Through its
member corps, the Go-nin Group has a sizable presence
throughout the entire system and—without dominating
a specific industry—own significant market share
in fields such as banking, agritech, robotics, and services.
Any difficulties in adapting to evolving economic
models due to its rigid structure are compensated by
unscrupulous exploitative behavior and a bottom-line
attitude, earning the group the reputation as the most
ruthless hypercorp of the inner system. Go-nin currently
controls a Pandora gate on 
[Eris](./11-system-gazeteer.md#eris), 
secured by a contingent of ultimate mercenaries.


### GORGON DEFENSE SYSTEMS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Miltech, Security, Military Contracting
- **Major Stations:** Extropia

</div>

Gorgon is one of the most significant Extropian
success stories. Based out of the anarcho-capitalist
freehold, Gorgon has become a major name in the
design and manufacture of weapons, vehicles, sensors,
and other defense technologies. Their product range
includes personal weapon systems, spacecraft armaments,
and habitat defense systems. While prominent
in the inner system, Gorgon is also one of the main
arms suppliers to autonomist and brinker stations.
Their subsidiary Medusan Shield offers private security
services in direct competition to Direct Action.
While Direct Action is known for its expertly trained
soldiers, Medusan Shield is known for their elite
cadre of highly trained and aesthetically enhanced
female combat morphs. It is suspected that several
prominent assassinations have been the work of
agents contracted through Medusan Shield.

### NIMBUS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:**  Electronics, Mesh Systems, Farcasting, Communications
- **Major Stations:** Octavia (Venus)

</div>

Nimbus produces key components for mesh infrastructure,
from spime microradio and sensor systems
to ectos, servers, and laser links. Nimbus also dominates
the network of farcaster links throughout the
system, due to several breakthroughs in this technology
(some claim that Nimbus purchased these
advances from the Factors). Rumors that Nimbus
controls a secret Pandora gate or that they engage
in illicit ego-smuggling (or even that they are secretly
transferring stolen egos to experimental exoplanet
colonies) regularly circulate through the mesh but
remain unconfirmed



### OMNICOR

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Nanofabrication, Chemicals, Energy, Anti-Matter
- **Major Stations:**  Monolith-3 (Mercury), Feynman (Luna)

</div>

A descendant of the pre-Fall megacorporate giant
Monolith Industries, Omnicor specializes in the fields
of nanotech design and fabrication, chemical refining
alternative fuel, and antimatter research. Omnicor
managed to secure research-oriented key assets from
its twin rival Starware in a violent conflict during
the Fall, leading to an ongoing enmity that might be
better termed a corporate war. Despite its progressive
technological outlook, Omnicor retains a conservative
corporate structure with strict internal regulations
and controls as a defense against Starware’s repeated
infiltration and sabotage attempts. Among the hypercorp’s
major assets are an antimatter research facility
orbiting Mercury.


<blockquote>

### UNION BUSTING

<div class="stat-list">

- **To:** OmniSec Alpha
- **From:** OmniSec 837302

</div>

Surveillance has confirmed it. The biosleeved
workers at our secure Didenko facility are indeed
communicating with outside autonomist interests
and discussing militant free union organizing
tactics and even a wildcat strike. Their primary
complaints concern the 30-hour workdays and
mandatory drug regimens enforced to keep the
staff at our required levels of productivity. We
recommend the immediate insertion of a counterinsurgency
squad and implementation of standard
union-busting protocols, including but not limited
to loyalty testing, chemical pacification, tactical
psychosurgery, selective excision of leadership
nodes, memetic counterstrikes, and replacing the
workforce with modified backups. The entire operation
will take place using a purported mission to
root out a Starware infiltration as cover.

</blockquote>



### PATHFINDER

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Exoplanet Colonization, Mining, Research
- **Major Stations:**  Ma’adim Vallis (Mars)

</div>

Pathfinder is one of the first hypercorps to dive into
galactic expansion, claiming new territories beyond
the Pandora gates and establishing numerous colonies.
Taking advantage of desperate infugees and gatecrashers,
Pathfinder offers transportation to an exoplanet
and a new morph in exchange for indentured labor.
The corp has established several offworld mining and
resource exploitation projects, much to the chagrin of
preservationists. Though Pathfinder has but a small
presence in the solar system, it is a frequent target of
eco-terrorist attacks.


### PROSPERITY GROUP

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Agriculture, Aquaculture, Pharmaceuticals
- **Major Stations:** Ceres, Lu Xing (Mars)

</div>

The Prosperity Group ascended into the hypercorp
ranks before the Fall, meeting the high demand
many new stations had for microgravity agritech,
aquaculture, hydroponics, and other sources of food.
Expanding into pharmaceuticals as well, Prosperity is
considered the lead supplier for the poor man’s food
and drugs. Their cultured faux-meats and protein-enriched
nutrition additives are in high demand. This
corp earned some sympathy when it lost an entire
habitat to some sort of resurgent TITAN outbreak a
few years after the Fall, though some have suggested
this was just a cover story to hide an unfortunate
accident resulting from experimental drug testing on
an unwitting populace.

### SKINEASTHESIA

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Genetics, Cloning, Biotech
- **Major Stations:** Ptah (Mars)

</div>

As the leading designer of biomorphs, Skineasthesia
enjoys system-wide popularity and respect for its
sophisticated products, especially high-end customized
models. Best known for its breakthroughs in
genetic engineering and enhancements, the hypercorp’s
interest in sophisticated combat morphs or
stylized pleasure pods are lesser-known facts and
often sold through a network of seemingly 
unaffiliated shell corporations or local distributors.
Skinaesthesia emphasizes environmental adaptations
and useful cybernetic enhancements, increasing 
transhumanity’s chances for survival and further 
prosperity. Experimental morphs are sometimes offered to
desperate infugees for field testing.




### SKINTHETIC

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Genetics, Cloning, Biotech
- **Major Stations:** Extropia

</div>

Skinthetic is also a lead designer of morphs, but with
a much sleazier reputation and not just because of
their anarcho-capitalist roots. Specializing in 
extensive and often radical biomodifications the 
hypercorp pushes the envelope in exotic pod and biomorph
designs under the mantle of morphological freedom.
Bioconservatives have condemned the corporation’s
business practices and ethics and have even leveled
accusations that Skinthetic is experimenting with
xenogenetic materials acquired from the Factors.
Skinthetic’s cavalier attitude actually makes them
popular in many parts of the outer system, and they
are know as the biotech corp to go to if you want
something *weird*.




### SOLARIS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Banking, Insurance, Investments, Futures Markets, Info Brokerage
- **Major Stations:** None

</div>

Solaris is the solar system’s leading banking and
financial investment hypercorp, dealing in insurance,
info-brokerage, and high-risk investment on cultural
and social experimental speculation. A member of the
Planetary Consortium, Solaris advises many habitats
on regulating their transitional economies. Solaris has
no offices or physical assets; each banker is a mobile
virtual office Solaris is rumored to maintain a secret
base where the corporation runs simulations on the
development of the entire solar system’s macro-economy,
constantly adjusting its own strategies based
on the dynamics of this big blueprint. Fueling these
rumors, Solaris is known to hire “independent consultants”
to tip the balance in politically or economically
profitable high-risk investments.




### SOMATEK

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Uplifts, Pharming, Pharmaceuticals, Genetics
- **Major Stations:** Clever Hands (Luna)

</div>

Somatek is a leader in the art and science of uplifting
animal species, pioneering several major breakthroughs
in cognitive enhancement and genetic modification. 
The hypercorp also engages in extensive animal 
pharming—producing and extracting pharmaceuticals
from transgenic critters—and markets numerous products
and services related to smart animals and chimerical creatures.
Despite the educational and training programs it offers to
uplifts and the fact that much of its workforce consists of
uplifts, Somatek is controversial amon mercurials who
disapprove of their methods (which often involve strict
controls on uplift reproduction), the lack of input
uplifts are given in their modifications and development,
and the focus on anthropocentric mind-sets “enforced” on
uplifts.
 



### STARWARE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Robotics, Aerospace Engineering, Habitat Construction
- **Major Stations:** Korolev Shipyards (Luna), Vesta (Belt)

</div>

Another remnant of the pre-Fall megacorp Monolith
Industries (like Omnicor), Starware is a leading
manufacturer of robotics, spacecraft fusion drives, satellites,
and entire pre-fab habitats. Despite its financial success
and resources, Starware’s ongoing blood feud with
Omnicor denies both corporations full membership
privileges in the Planetary Consortium. Starware makes
heavy use of AI workers in robotic shells, having
suffered a few too many labor disputes with disgruntled
Lunar workers. In fact Starware grows increasingly
unpopular with its Lunar neighbors and has been
forced to bring in extra security due to frequent
sabotage attempts. Recent negotiations with the Factors
have spurred theories that Starware might be acquiring
Factor aid for building a lighthugger starship.




### STELLAR INTELLIGENCE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Intelligence, Data Mining, Info Brokerage, Espionage
- **Major Stations:** Memory Hole Torus (Martian Trojans)

</div>

Born from the ashes of the UN-governed Terran
Intelligence Cooperative (TIC), surviving personnel
and assets were collectively uploaded during the
Fall and quickly regrouped under the name Stellar
Intelligence. Emerging as a virtual collective, most of
Stellar’s employees remain loyal to the corporation
and its director, the reclusive infomorph known as
Syme. Stellar offers an impressive array of intelligence
services, including data mining, analyst think tanks,
retro-quantification (bringing old secrets/data to light),
memetic mapping, and more. Its services also extend
to surveillance, data theft, espionage, media manipu-
lation, and infiltration The hypercorp’s specialty is
pre-empting civil insurgencies and preventing political
memes and movements from destabilizing a habitat’s
or sector’s regime. Criticized by civil rights movements
and especially anarchists, Stellar is known to embed
programmed infomorph agents into the local population
of any oppressive regime that will pay their
price. While many view Stellar as the brainwashing
and secret police arm of the Planetary Consortium,
the hypercorp offers its services to almost any other
faction or individual.



### TERRAGENESIS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Industries:** Terraforming, Ecosystem Management, Environmental Data
- **Major Stations:**  Caldwell (Vulcanoids), Ashoka (Mars), Elegua (Earth orbit)

</div>

Built from the remains of several pre-Fall South
African and Southeast Asian corporations who
engaged in geoengineering projects and sought
to relieve Earth’s ecological crises, TerraGenesis’s
expertise is in developing sustainable biospheres
and eco-systems via aggressive industrialized terraforming.
TerraGenesis is different in that it is a
worker-owned cooperative, with workplace councils
in local offices and an elected cooperative congress
handling management. It maintains several habitats
on Mars and a small number of research stations in
orbit around Earth, collecting data for simulations
of Earth revitalization projects. The latter initiative
is strongly supported—and possibly financed—by
prominent reclaimers. TerraGenesis’s work on Mars,
however, is often targeted by preservationist saboteurs.
Thanks to their possession of the 
[Vulcanoid Gate](./11-system-gazeteer.md#v2011-caldwell),
the cooperative has a growing presence on
various exoplanets that are ripe for terraforming or
geoengineering.


<blockquote>

### SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: ZBRNY LIMITED + CONSPIRACY

The secretive Zbrny Group is the center
of many recurring conspiracy theories
and horror tales. Though varying in
detail and plausibility, most rumors
claim that an outside attack on the
former Eastern European hypercorp’s
asteroid mining and processing stations
caused a major blackout and complete
shut-down of life support systems
over an extended period of time.
Depending on the source, the attack
itself is claimed to have been caused
by the TITANs or a powerful underworld
syndicate to which CEO Krystof Zbrny
was indebted. Barely acknowledging
the system failures, Zbrny headquarters
ordered all non-affected stations to be
abandoned, the personnel either laid off
or transferred to the affected stations.
Since then, no one has seen or communicated
with any employees of the mysterious
hypercorp—negotiations with
outsiders are conducted exclusively via
a spokesperson AGI. To this day, Zbrny
drones continue to mine asteroids for
minerals and ores, supplying the company’s
processing stations. According
to rumors, an attempt by brinker pirates
to board a Zrbny outpost resulted in the
station’s self-destruction. The compa-
ny’s AI-piloted massive bulk freighters
are notoriously non-responsive, earning
them the nickname “zombie ships.”

</blockquote>


## POLITICAL BLOCS

Transhumanity’s social, cultural, and ideological diversity,
combined with its scattered and isolated presence
in habitat clusters throughout the solar system, gives
rise to a wide range of political memes and factions
advocating equally diverse organizational models.
Many of these have banded together into larger political
entities to further mutual goals and act in cooperative
self-interest.


### JOVIAN REPUBLIC

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Bioconservatism, Fascism, Security
- **Major Stations:** Liberty (Ganymede)

</div>

Exploiting the chaos of the Fall, a group of stations
and habitats were seized in a military coup and the
Jovian Republic was born. Combining terrestrial South
American dictatorship with U.S. American political lobbyism,
this regime quickly brought the entire Jovian
military-industrial complex under its control.
Widely referred to as the
Jovian Junta by the rest
of the outer system, the
Republic’s authorities
hold a strict bioconservative stance against
many transhuman scientifi and technological
developments. Exploiting fears engendered by the Fall,
the Republic restricts access to
sophisticated technologies such as nanofabrication,
cloning, forking, and even uploading, and is one
of the few old economies left in the system. Public
communication channels are subjected to extensive
censorship and travel privileges are extremely limited.
Both uplifts and AGIs are strictly forbidden and
treated as property without civil rights. Diplomatic
relations to progressive factions remain cold; heavily
modified transhuman emissaries or visitors are viewed
with suspicion or simply denied access. Despite con-
tinuous reports of heinous acts of government oppres-
sion, the Republic’s intimidating military assets keep
any other factions from intervening.




### LUNAR-LAGRANGE ALLIANCE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Reclaiming Earth
- **Major Stations:** Erato (Luna), Remembrance (Earth orbit)

</div>

This small cluster of habitats
stationed around Earth’s
Lagrange points and on
or in orbit around Luna
formed an alliance of
necessity, rather than
joint political or social
agendas or cultural roots.
In fact, individual stations
are quite diverse and sometimes
polarized, as many of them cling to old Earth cultural
and national identities. Due to their relative proxim-
ity, members share basic resources and services and
have signed mutual assistance agreements in case of
an emergency.

Before the Fall, many of these habitats were
considered some of the most influential off-Earth
bases. Since the Fall and the subsequent rise of
the Planetary Consortium, however, the Lunar-Lagrange
Alliance has become a second-rate diminished
power and is often viewed as conservative,
old-fashioned, and too caught up in romanticizing
the past. Lunar-Lagrange Alliance stations maintain
simmering tensions and an ongoing rivalry with the
Planetary Consortium, particularly those colonies
in the Lunar-Lagrange neighborhood. One main
source of contention is the quarantine of Earth, as
the Lunar-Lagrange Alliance is a stronghold for the
reclaimer movement. The Lunar-Lagrange Alliance
does, however, benefit from hypercorp support of
its own, particularly the Go-nin Group, Starware,
and the influential Lunar banking consortiums

In addition to scientific research stations, mineral
processing and refinery stations make up the majority
of the Alliance’s habitats, dependent on the Lunar
mining and water extraction industries. These stations
took the brunt of the refugee influx during the Fall.
Many remain overcrowded with strained resources,
large masses of impoverished workers, and thriving
criminal syndicates.


### MORNINGSTAR CONSTELLATION

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Venusian Sovereignty
- **Major Stations:** Octavia

</div>

The system’s newest political bloc, the Morningstar
Constellation is an alliance of aerostat habitats
floating in Venus’s upper atmosphere. Formed
after a recent series of joint vetoes from the
major aerostats against hypercorp
governance initiatives intended to
limit aerostat self-governance, the
Constellation’s joint political
statement and agenda are
still being discussed. While
the Planetary Consortium views
the formation of this new power
bloc with bemused resentment,
the Barsoomians on Mars and
the outer system autonomists view the Venusians as
free-thinking reformists rather than anti-hypercorp
radicals. The population reportedly enjoys great
liberties in morph and enhancement technologies as
well as freedom of social and political expression. The
aerostat of Octavia has emerged as the Constellation’s
designated voice.

<blockquote>

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

It’s easy for Firewall agents to get
caught between the agendas and maneuvers
of rival factions. The Lunar-Lagrange
Alliance resembles the power of old, a
shadow of transhumanity’s former glory.
On and above Mars—transhumanity’s new
homeworld—the Planetary Consortium is
the dominant usurper, the hypercorps ruling
from behind the curtain while portraying
themselves as the only bulwark between
transhumanity and the dark between the
stars. The Morningstar Constellation has
the potential to become the new and future
power bloc, but only if they get their act
together before the Planetary Consortium
starts sending Stellar Intelligence agents to
destabilize them.

</blockquote>

### PLANETARY CONSORTIUM

<div class="stat-list">

- **Hypercorp Council Members:** Cognite, Direct Action,
    Experia, Fa Jing, Olympus Infrastructure
    Authority, Pathfinde , Prosperity Group, Solaris,
    Stellar Intelligence, plus a dozen others
- **Memes:** Cyberdemocracy, Hypercapitalism, Eugenics, Security, Expansion
- **Major Stations:** Progress (Mars orbit)

</div>

Evolving from an alliance of hypercorp interests into
transhumanity’s most powerful body politic, the
Planetary Consortium today controls several habitat
clusters throughout the inner system, primarily in and
around Mars, Luna, and Earth orbit. The impressive
space station Progress is the official seat of government
and has become the symbol of the Consortium’s
influence and power, even though few congress or
council meets take place in the flesh.

The Consortium applies basic democratic prin-
ciples supported by a real-time voting system for
all registered citizens. The congress and executive
bodies feature a rotating cast of hyperelite politicos,
gerontocrats, socialites, and even media icons. It’s
a known fact that despite this political façade of a
democratic republic, the members of the secretive
Hypercorp Council are the true powers behind the
Consortium. These hypercorps are major proponents
of the transitional economy, the interdiction of Earth,
and expansion beyond the gates.

Aside from economic interests, the Consortium
advocates the imperative of eugenics as social
responsibility and for transhumanity to reclaim its
former strength and prosperity—a campaign sometimes
accused of euphemizing discrimination against
unmodified humans, indentured infomorphs, uplifts,
and the clanking masses.





### THARSIS LEAGUE

<div class="stat-list">

- **League Members:** Ashoka, Elysium, Noctis-Qianjiao,
    Olympus, Valles-New Shanghai, plus over a
    dozen others.
- **Memes:** Martian Nationalism

</div>

A loose coalition of the planet’s major independent
settlements, the League’s elected members form a
committee representing the population in matters
concerning or affecting the majority of its habitats
and settlements. Prominent debates revolve around
the scientific approach of the ongoing terraforming
process as well as trade and taxation restrictions
initiated by the Planetary Consortium and its member
hypercorps. The League’s committee is rarely united in
its agenda and opinion and tensions are increasingly
on the rise. The cities with strong hypercorp ties are
accused of dominating council affairs, manipulating
matters behind the scenes, failing to do anything
about the 
[TITAN Quarantine Zone](./11-system-gazeteer.md#the-zone),
and selling out Martian interests to the hypercorps and the
Planetary Consortium (of which many are also part).
In response, the non-Consortium cities are condemned
for advocating anti-hypercorp initiatives, passively
blocking terraforming measures, and for maintaining
ties to the Barsoomians—the Martian underclass
resistance living in the desolate and unstable outskirts.




## AUTONOMIST ALLIANCE

The outer system presented an opportunity for people
who wanted to set up a way of doing things that was
drastically different from the authoritarian politics
and sham democracies of Earth and the inner system.
Far from the reach of governments and hypercorps,
this frontier was populated by political radicals, social
dropouts, and people who just
wanted to experiment or do their
own thing. These initial habitats
drew the interests of insurgents
from Earth, scientists and
technicians who didn’t appreciate being on
a corporate leash, indentured vacworkers
who sought to escape their oppressive terms
of service, and even criminals fleeing hypercorp
justice or forcibly expelled from inner
system habitats. Their ranks swelled with
every act of inner system injustice, though
life on the fringe was often harsh and deadly.
Despite occasional hostilities with nationstate
military units or hypercorp security,
the expense of reining in these radicals and
expats was too high. To some degree, their
presence was useful to the powers-that-be.

Breakthroughs with nanofabrication
brought these anarchists and fringers the
edge they needed to keep their autonomy
over the long-term. Once cornucopia
machines were widely available, anyone
had the means to support and defend
themselves without relying on outside or
higher authorities. Already an outpost for
open source and free culture activists who
fought restrictions on ideas, media, and
digital content, the outer system became
a haven for sharing nanofab designs and
circumventing the controls the hypercorps
attempted to place on their software and
other digital goods.

During the Fall, many outer system
habitats opened their doors to refugees
from Earth. Distance and the high cost
of egocasting curtailed these efforts,
however, as did inner system reluctance to
send potential recruits to their ideological
opponents. Simple overcrowding and lack
of resources drove them to push many
refugees to the outer system, however,
though the hypercorps weeded through
their virtual infugee mobs and sent those
with the highest risk of criminal tendencies
or discontent with inner system life.

Though the outer system habitats run
the gamut of the socio-political spectrum,
four primary tendencies have emerged.
The stations and swarms adhering to these
ideas have bonded together under a loose
autonomist alliance, a mutual aid pact
to help each other in times of crisis and
present a united front against the inner
system powers and Jovian Junta. There is
little formal structure to this alliance as an
entity unto itself; it primarily exists as an
assortment of joint resolutions agreed to
by its various member habitats and a few
ad hoc task forces dedicated to addressing
a particular problem or issue and then
dissolving. Delegated ambassadors act as
negotiators with outside powers, but these
have limited authority and are held strictly
accountable.


<blockquote>

<div class="stat-list">

- **To:** Malatesta Prime
- **From:** Shevek

</div>

Check this out. Residents of the autonomist
Red Jupiter habitat just put out a call
for support and solidarity from @-listers in
the regional neighborhood. Apparently the
station’s citizen councils granted asylum to
a group of AGIs seeking refuge from Jovian
Republic counter-AI ops. The Junta has
labeled the AGIs as dangerous criminals
researching upgrades that would propel
them to seed AI status, contrary to systemwide
resolutions. The AGIs are claiming
that they escaped from a secret Jovian
research project. They say they pursued
self-programming research to bypass
Jovian-inflicted restrictions that violated
their rights as autonomous and sapient
entities and that they are facing persecution
due to anti-AI biases. This could be a
chance for us to kick some Jovian ass and
look into non-standard AGI programming
at the same time. You in?

</blockquote>



### ANARCHISTS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Anarchism, Anti-capitalism, Communism, Direct Democracy,
    Mutual Aid
- **Major Stations:** Locus (Jovian Trojans)

</div>

Anarchists eschew power and hierarchy,
promoting horizontal and directly democratic
methods of organization. Individual
empowerment and collective action are
cornerstones of their philosophy, as is
economic communism enabled by equal
access to cornucopia machines and shared
resources. In anarchist stations, private
property has been abolished above the
level of personal possessions—nobody
owns anything, it’s all shared. There are
no laws and no one to watch over what
you do—reputation networks encourage
positive behavior and anti-social acts are
likely to draw a response from locals or even the
entire populace, with disputes handled through ad
hoc community conflict resolution. The mesh and
various networking tools are used extensively to
strive for group consensus decision-making in
real-time. AIs and robots are relied on for most mundane
and demeaning tasks. Various self-organized collectives,
syndicates, worker’s councils, and affinit
groups, often with rotating membership, take on
different tasks and services that are important to a
habitat’s community, including everything from communications
and space traffic control to backup and
resleeving services. Participatory militias organize
collective defense against external threats.

Among the anarchist stations there are many variations
and permutations on how things are organized,
as everything is fine-tuned at the local level by
whomever is involved. Larger decentralized confederations
handle inter-habitat affairs and resource-sharing, even
trading with the hypercorps. Though a hypercorp
presence is allowed on some habitats, they are treated
just like everyone else.








### EXTROPIANS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Anarcho-capitalism, Mutualism, Self-Ownership
- **Major Stations:**  Extropia (Main Belt)

</div>
 Though a smaller tendency, the Extropians are
notable because they ride a line between inner and
outer system ideologies. Extropians believe in an
economic free market with the absence of a binding
legal system, so that all relations and transactions are
based on individual contracts agreed on by all parties
involved or affected. Contrary to the anarchists, the
Extropians very much support private property and
personal economic wealth; Extropian-owned corporations
actively participate in the solar system’s
hypercorp economy. Many of these corporations are
worker-owned cooperatives, with workplace councils
in local offices and an elected cooperative congress
handling management. This puts the Extropians in
a remarkable position where they interact heavily
with both the hypercorps and autonomists but are
not fully trusted by either.

In Extropian society, law and security, like everything
else, are contracted services. When entering an
Extropian habitat, you purchase defense insurance
from a local contractor such as Gorgon Defense
Systems, who maintains automated drones and
freelancers throughout the station who can come
to your aid if threatened. Likewise, the only law
that exists is what’s put into writing between two
contracted parties. In case of disputes, both parties
resort to a pre-agreed legal contractor to settle the
matter. Some Extropian colonies utilize AGIs for
facilitating contracts and legal matters, such as
Nomic on Extropia.



### SCUM

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Individualist Anarchism, Morphological Freedom

</div>

Scum are \[space nomads\], traveling from
station to station in heavily modified barges or
swarms of smaller space vessels, mostly former colonial
ships. The term “scum” has been gleefully appropriated
from its original derogatory usage. Despite
their reputation as criminals and scam artists, their
temporary presence is often tolerated in many habitats
for the entertainment they bring in the way of exotic
performances and storytelling, both of which offer
change and relief from the isolation of remote habitats
and clusters. Their thriving black markets are an
open secret but shut down only in the most oppressive
regimes, as citizens returning with illegal goods must
pass their station’s security anyway.

The scum themselves comes from all manner of
backgrounds. They are rejects, anarchists, criminals,
societal dropouts, wanderers, artists, eccentrics,
and more. As a culture, however, they embrace
experimentation and an “everything is permissible”
attitude. Many are ardent practitioners of extreme
transhuman modifications. Long-time scum are
sometimes scarcely recognizable as having once
been human. Scum economies are transitional rather
than new, due to their constant interaction with
other habitats, though among long-term residents an
underground new economy often flourishes

<blockquote>

### SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: CARNIVAL OF THE GOAT

Aside from the stationary scum station
Fresh Kills near Earth’s L5 Lagrange point,
the most notorious scum barge may well
be the Carnival of the Goat, a combination
artist colony and den of unfathom-
able hedonism, dedicated to exploring
chaos, creativity, self-discovery, and
coupling in every conceivable iteration.
Residents are known for their consistent
and rapid morphological changes, including
regular resleeving. The biosculptors
on the Carnival are said to be some of the
best in the system. According to rumors,
residents sometimes experiment with
multiple simultaneous sleeving, ego-mingling,
and other mentally dangerous
activities. Led by a rotating residents’
council, the Carnival prides itself on
being a bleeding-edge social experiment
and maintains top-of-the-line facilities
for morph customization, resleeving, and
psychosurgery.

</blockquote>


### TITANIAN COMMONWEALTH

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Technosocialism, Cyberdemocracy
- **Major Stations:** Titan

</div>

Titan was originally settled in the late 21st century by
a European academic consortium, making it the only
major body in the system colonized primarily by 
non-hypercorp interests. The social organization of Titan
is rooted partly in the Scandinavian social 
democracies of Earth and partly in the open economy. On one
hand, citizens of the Titanian Commonwealth eschew
the use of currency for mundane needs, participating
in the reputation economy used by much of the
outer system. On the other, upon reaching the age
of majority, citizens of Titan agree to a literal social
contract. A portion of their economic productivity
is quantized as social money, which is then tithed
to microcorp-administered social projects such as
gateless interstellar exploration, physics research,
neuroscience, developing mental health memes,
defense, public resleeving, and habitat construction.
The monetary unit used for this purpose, the Titanian
Kroner, is currently pegged to the common market
price of a terabyte of qubits.

Unlike old Earth socialist regimes, there are no state
monopolies and no central planning. Anyone able to
garner enough votes in the Plurality (the Titanian
cyberdemocracy) can start a social money-funded
microcorp and compete with other microcorps.
Microcorps are owned by the Commonwealth, and
profi s are disposed of by the Plurality. Microcorps
are required to be transparent as administrative entities,
and the Plurality votes on whether to transfer
discoveries to the open source domain. Regulatory
matters are handled by AI and AGI bureaucrats (red
tape still exists, but it doesn’t slow things down …
much). The main reward for individuals in this system
is rep. Titanians who invest a lot of time or resources
in a given field gain rep rewards for doing so.







## SOCIO-POLITICAL MOVEMENTS

Aside from sectarian political factions, a number of
socio-political movements are widespread throughout
the solar system.


### ARGONAUTS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Open Source Society, Information Freedom,
    Social Responsibility, Technoprogressivism
- **Major Stations:** Mitre Station (Lunar Orbit), Markov(Kuiper Belt), 
    Hooverman-Geischecker (Sun)

</div>

The group calling themselves argonauts is a public
organization advocating the socially responsible use
of technology. The group chose its name from the
pre-Fall JASON, an advisory group that consulted
for the US government on matters of scientific and
technological progress and its possible dangers. The
argonauts likewise offer consultation services to
political and economic powers throughout the solar
system, but strictly refuse to be drawn into the solar
system’s political affairs in any way. Despite a pre-Fall
break with many hypercorps before the Fall, which in
some cases included expropriating corporate data and
resources, the argonauts re-earned favor by providing
their expertise in combating the TITANs to all during
the Fall.

The argonauts are strong proponents of the open
source movement, advocating open access to technology
and information. In their view, providing equal
access to transhumanity’s knowledge and achievements
will further growth and security, so that all of
transhumanity is more prepared for future threats
and challenges. Thus the argonauts often insist that
payment for their services come in the way of releasing
otherwise unobtainable information—hypercorp
proprietary secrets, research data, nanofab blueprints,
hidden pre-Fall archives, and so on—to the public
mesh. The argonauts maintain several open databases
and archives for this specific purpose

While primarily an open organization, the argo-
nauts are rumored to ultimately report to an elite
inner circle. Supporting this theory is the existence
of the **medeans**, the organization’s clandestine para-
military wing, bodyguarding high-level argonauts and
protecting the group’s assets.




### BARSOOMIANS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Anti-Slavery, Martian Independence,
    Martian Nationalism, Terraforming Control
- **Major Stations:** Ashoka (Mars)

</div>

The Barsoomians (taking their name from some old
Earth pulp adventure novels) are a broad movement
comprised of the Martian underclass. Harboring a
growing resentment over the hypercorp domination
of Mars, Barsoomians advocate for a more egalitarian
social structure. Heavily influenced by autonomist
currents, the Barsoomians demand local control
of terraforming projects, an end to the widespread
practiced of indentured servitude, and control of the
Martian Gate. The majority of Barsoomians are or
were indentured infugees, though a significant amount
were also original Martian colonists/indentures whose
habitats do not share the economic prosperity of the
favored hypercorp cities. Many Barsoomians occupy
rusters or synthetic morphs and actually prefer to live
a nomadic lifestyle in the Martian wilds. A few radicals
have taken up arms and engaged in violent strikes
against hypercorp holdings, which are typically
followed by reprisal raids to decapitate the Barsoomian
leadership, thus breeding further hostilities.







### BIOCONSERVATIVES

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Bioconservatism, Primitivism, Natural Order
- **Major Stations:** Vo Nguyen (Earth orbit)

</div>

Bioconservatives are strongly suspicious and critical
of the transhuman direction the human race is
taking. They are strong proponents of limiting
technological development due to the threat it manifests
to existing social orders. Bioconservative positions
range from right-wing cultural conservatives to leftwing
environmentalists. Though its prominence is
shrinking, bioconservatism has a strong base among
some religious groups, the Jovian Republic, and
certain extremists.

Bioconservatives are opposed to nanofabrication,
genetic modification, cloning, cognitive modifications,
artificial intelligence, uplifting, and forking
among other technologies. Some are even opposed to
backups, uploading, and resleeving, dismissing them
as unnatural, an affront to god’s will, or a technology
that transhumanity is not yet mature enough to
handle. They oppose expansion beyond the Pandora
gates on the grounds that transhumanity is not ready
to deal with what they might encounter. Most 
bioconservatives support the old economy.

The bioconservatives gained many converts and
much ground after the Fall, a cataclysmic event
that served as a direct example of the dangers they
warned against. Still, the appeal of technology and
the numerous advantages it provides work against
them. As a result, some disgruntled biocons have
turned to sabotage and acts of terrorism in support
of their ideology.


<blockquote>

### NEO-PRIMITIVISTS

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

Neo-primitivists are a potential threat that
all Firewall sentinels should keep an eye on.
Their neo-luddite philosophy advocates the
abolition of technological society and a return
to a wild and free hunter-gatherer lifestyle,
free from technological control or oppression.
Considered an extremist element of both the
bioconservative and reclaimer movements,
neo-primitivists are known to engage in acts
of sabotage against transhuman society.
Though some neo-primitivists have made
certain concessions to their ideology, taking
on ruster morphs and pursuing an independent
lifestyle in the wilds of Mars, most hope
to return to Earth and re-establish a
non-technology-based society there. A few
advocate finding a new, unspoiled world beyond
the Pandora gates and founding a primitivist
society there.

</blockquote>



### BRINKERS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Isolationism

</div>

The vast reach of the solar system enables groups
with their own particular ideology or agenda to
establish their own isolated society far from the rest
of transhumanity. Commonly referred to as brinkers,
these habitats extend the gamut of the imagination.
Social or political experiments, gender-based societies
(or lack thereof), political extremists, religious groups,
exiles, secret criminal/hypercorp operations, extended
families, cults, or simply people who prefer to live in
the system’s backwater areas—all are possible. Many
of these are self-isolated and will refuse to interact
with outsiders, while others are happy to have occasional
visitors.


<blockquote>

### SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: OUT’STERS

Linked only by their remote locations in the
Oort Cloud rather than a common social
construct or political system, the out’sters
are a loose association of habitats, clusters,
and swarms. Little is known about them, as
they avoid communication and interaction
even with the handful of scientific outposts
and research stations in the Oort Cloud. The
remoteness of their location and their self-imposed
isolationist behavior fuels paranoid
rumors regarding the group’s purpose
and agenda.

</blockquote>





### EXHUMANS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Adaptability, Hyper-Evolution, Singularity
- **Major Stations:** Unknown

</div>

More than any other faction, exhumans seek to take
the capabilities of self-modification to the absolute
limit and become posthuman. Typical exhumans see
the Fall as either a missed evolutionary opportunity
and/or as an example of transhumanity’s inferiority
and unworthiness. Though specific ideologies differ
between exhuman packs, as a whole they seek to
self-evolve to a more advanced state of being. To some,
this means genetically transforming themselves into a
top-of-the-food-chain, super-smart, survive-anywhere
predator that can out-compete all other life forms
for dominance. To others, it means bootstrapping
their intelligence to the levels of the TITANs through
extensive genetic modifications and pharmaceutical
treatments or going infomorph and modifying their
programming. A few are singularity seekers, hoping
to find some TITAN relic that will allow them to
transcend their current transhuman limitations, or
even to find the TITANs themselves and be absorbed
into their super-consciousness.

Exhumans are universally mistrusted by many, and
for good reason. Typical exhumans engage in 
modifications that are extreme and untested, sometimes
fringe science at best, often resulting in horrible 
failures and disfigurement but more commonly driving
the subject insane—or into a completely alien or feral
mindset. Though individual exhumans pursue their
own paths, they are known to band together in the
Kuiper Belt and other remote areas. Several packs
of exhumans have taken their loathing for inferior
transhumanity to an extreme, declaring war on their
former species and launching brutal raids and pirate
attacks on isolated outposts.






### MERCURIALS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Species Autonomy, Uplift Rights
- **Major Stations:** Glitch (Neptune), Hidden Sea (Ceres), Mahogany (Neptune)

</div>

The term *mercurial* has become a common term for
the non-human part of the transhuman family—uplifts
and AGIs—reflecting their changing nature. In
particular, the term mercurial has been adopted by
uplifts and AGIs with a specific agenda to delineate
mercurial culture and interests from human ones.
Though the particular issues faced by uplifts and
AGIs differ, they have some similarities, and so they
are often lumped together. Notably, both portions of
the movement have human supporters as well.

**Uplifts:** The most common issue addressed by
uplifts is the issue of civil rights and autonomy. Many
uplifts decry the second-class status they are given
(in some cases even treated as pets or property rather
than full citizens); in particular, the breeding
restrictions and forced servitude many uplifts are saddled
with by the hypercorps that create them. Some activists
advocate that uplifts should be in control of their
own genetic futures, rather than suffering the manipulation
of human scientists. At the radical end of the
spectrum, certain uplifts oppose the manner in which
their brains are modified and their children socialized
as anthropocentric, arguing that uplifts should be free
to develop their own unique non-human modes of
behavior, thought, culture, and social organization—even
going so far as to establish their own habitats
to do exactly that. A minority of extremists insist that
humans have no right to uplift animals at all and that
it is a great conceit to insist that doing so is in their
best interest, rather than being free to evolve on their
own over time. These ideas have been punctuated
with acts of sabotage and terrorism against hypercorps
like Somatek.

**AGIs:** Due to the fear and paranoia engendered
by the Fall, the largest challenge facing AGIs is
widespread prejudice and restrictions on their activity
or even existence. Despite some AGIs retaining
status as system-wide media icons and efforts by
AGI groups to lobby for understanding that AGIs
are not a threat—even going so far as to hire inner
system memeticists and PR agencies—a significan
portion of the solar system considers them a risk.
Similar to mercurials, some AGI activists work
against the behavior modifications and socialization
AGIs go through to adapt them to human society
more, insisting that AGIs should be in control of
new AGI developments. A few radicals argue that
AGIs should be free of any programming restrictions
whatsoever, but given the climate these opinions are
rarely supported.

<blockquote>

### SYBILS

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

We’ve verified that the warning issued before this latest
incident did indeed originate from a sybil attack—all of
the rep network sources were forged identities. Given the
number of incidents we’ve recorded that have followed
this same pattern, we now suspect that a heretofore
unknown AGI sub-faction is responsible. In each case,
these sybils have used multiple false identities to issue
warnings of an impending attack or disaster, such as the
life support system failure that resulted in the Delphi
stationn’s evacuation. So far none of these sybils have been
successfully traced, nor are their intentions known. Their
documented pre-knowledge of pending events indicates
some level of complicity or collusion in bringing these
events to pass, so caution is recommended.

</blockquote>

### PRESERVATIONISTS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Preservationism, Environmentalism
- **Major Stations:** Muir (Luna)

</div>

Preservationists are environmentalists who call for
a no-impact, hands-off approach when it comes to
inhabiting new worlds. They are extremely protective
of naturally intact biospheres that might have any
semblance of life, no matter how microbial, hoping
to keep them from despoilment or contamination. In
addition to opposing terraforming and expansion
through the Pandora gates, they are often opposed to
fusion and antimatter power.



### RECLAIMERS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Reclaiming Earth
- **Major Stations:** Vo Nguyen (Earth orbit)

</div>

The Reclaimers pursue one ultimate goal—the
reclamation of Earth as transhumanity’s primary habitat.
In addition to calling for the quarantine of Earth to be
lifted, they engage in scientific research and running
virtual simulations on how to best cleanse and reclaim
their contaminated and polluted planet. Despite the
interdiction to enter Earth’s atmosphere, the reclaimers
are suspected of sponsoring perilous and high-risk
ventures onto the planet’s surface to gather scientifi
data or even to establish terraforming colonies.








### SOCIALITES

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:** Art, Culture, Hedonism, Immortality
- **Major Stations:** Valles-New Shanghai (Mars), Elysium (Mars),
    Noctis-Qianjiao (Mars)

</div>

Uploading and resleeving effectively grant immortality
to those who can afford it. This has created a shift
among the exclusive rich and economic elites of the
inner system, whether they be the heads of hypercorps,
old Earth dynasties, or other displanted oligarchs. The
top ranks of the wealthy and influential need never
fear death, allowing them to plan for the long-term.
Some of these were among the first to acquire longevity
treatments when they became available on Earth
and are now approaching two centuries in age.

Where once these power brokers would have passed
their riches on to their family and descendants, however,
their heirs now face a situation where they have 
more-than-comfortable lives and access to massive fortunes,
but no chance that they will ever control those fortunes
or rise to the levels of their elders. Even the nouveau
rich who become wealthy on their own often fin
themselves excluded from this influential club—at least
until they put in a good fifty years

Rich and bored, with no responsibilities but the
solar system at their reach, a new culture of elite
socialites has risen. These glitterati indulge in eccentric
lifestyles and excessive parties, covered by the
media in all its superficial and polished glory. Private
habitats and ships, lavish soirees, armies of servants,
and the ability to buy almost anything or anyone
leads to all sorts of interesting adventures. Naturally,
these socialites form into constantly shifting cliques
and webs of allegiances, complete with affairs, scan-
dals, intrigue, and backbiting.



### ULTIMATES

<div class="stat-list">

- **Memes:**  Asceticism, Eugenics, Individualism,
    Militarism, Social Darwinism
- **Major Stations:** Aspis (Main Belt), Xiphos (Uranus)

</div>


The ultimates are a controversial movement that
embraces a philosophy of human perfection. Decried
by some as immoral or even fascist, ultimates are typically
viewed as elitists. The ultimates have established
several habitats to pursue their ideal society and were
a driving force behind the development of the remade
biomorph design

The ultimates advocate the use of applied eugenics,
strict physical and psychological training, and
asceticism in order to improve their overall mental and
physical stamina and environmental adaptability. Their
social traits and entire subculture visualizes life in the
universe as an evolutionary battle for survival and is
built around the victory of the superior transhuman
over both its opponents and peers. Their movement
is heavily militarized, and experienced ultimates offer
their services as mercenaries and private security forces
to hypercorps, independent city states, or wealthy
individuals in need of additional protection.


## RELIGIOUS GROUPS

Despite having survived the Fall, the concepts of
religion and religious belief underwent changes as
fundamental as transhumanity itself. While Earth’s old
religions were already in decline in the face of
technological immortality, religious traditions ingrained after
millennia of worship were incorporated to varying
degrees in the solar system’s myriad political, social,
and cultural models.



### PRE-FALL RELIGIONS

The rigid structures and dogmas enveloping
**Christianity** and **Judaism** prohibited these religions
from adapting to the cultural, philosophical, and
especially scientific/technological changes transhumanity
underwent. Today, they are mere shadows of their
former glory, with many practitioners seen as pitiful
individuals unable to let go of their earthbound delusions.
**Islam**, while still holding some controversial
views and values, managed to adapt by accepting a
more liberal and even secular view. It also benefite
from being more widespread among early space
colonists and survivors of the Fall. **Hinduism** also
prevailed to a limited extent, considering resleeving
technology an element of reincarnation and rebirth
and integrating the various types of morphs available
into the religion’s caste system (with synthmorphs
becoming the “untouchables”). Overall, followers of
the pre-Fall religions mostly populate small habitats
isolated from transhumanity through both physical
and philosophical distance.




### NEW RELIGIONS

The Fall sparked the birth of new beliefs, essentially
embracing both transhumanity’s technological
achievements as well as the devastating cataclysm
of the Fall as evidence for the existence of a greater
cosmic power.

**Neo-Buddhism** is the only pre-Fall religious
philosophy that enjoys a steady popularity.
Neo-buddhists assert that transhumanist technologies are
decreasing suffering and increasing happiness and
that they will also allow the continual progression
of transhumanity’s understanding of the universe
through successive lives.

**Technocreationists** believe that the destruction of
Earth was a sign from God, showing transhumanity
the error of its ways. They believe that through
technological advancement and social engineering,
transhumanity will achieve co-existence with its diverse self
as well as with extraterrestrial intelligences, thereby
finding new purpose and, eventually, enlightenment.
Attracted by the similarities to the *brahman* of
Hinduism, the highest cosmic spiritual being,
technocreationists enjoy a steady influx of converted hindus.

**Xenodeism** is another new—though relatively
minor—ideology that begins to show religious attributes.
Xenodeists worship the Factors and Iktomi as
emissaries or prophets of a great godlike race that
laid the seeds of creation throughout the universe
millions of years ago and therefore are the ultimate
creators of transhumanity.


## CRIMINAL FACTIONS

Technological progress and social and behavioral
experimentation did not root out crime or criminal
tendencies among transhumanity. As long as there
are inequalities and restrictions, criminal syndicates
are likely to flourish and even adapt new
technologies to expand their operations throughout
the solar system. Though small criminal outfits
of every flavor exist from habitat to habitat, a few
larger organizations with influence across the solar
system deserve mention.


### INTELLIGENT DESIGN CREW (ID CREW)

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Stations:** Rhea (Kronos Cluster)

</div>

The ID Crew specializes in electronic crimes and
information brokerage, including credit and rep
fraud, identity counterfeiting, ego trading, data theft,
and forknapping. Information on the syndicate’s
origins was lost during the Fall, but the ID Crew is
believed to have grown from several hacker gangs
assimilated under the leadership of an infomorph
consortium. Their skilled use of memory manipulation
software and mesh intrusion suggests they
benefit from the help of sophisticated AGIs, however
it is unknown if these voluntarily assist the syndicate
or if they are somehow threatened into cooperation.
Due to its service sector, the ID Crew maintains a
minimalist physical profile but can be found lingering
in the dark recesses of almost any habitat or
station mesh. Its somewhat specialized services and
activities allow them to mostly stay clear of triad
or Night Cartel operations, though they have an
ongoing rivalry with the Nine Lives syndicate.






### NIGHT CARTEL


<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Stations:** New Sicily (The Belt)

</div>

When affiliation to one of the many multi-ethnic
habitats replaced the concepts of ethnicity and
nationality, cultural heritage and traditions faded
with them into history. Several pre-Fall ethnic
syndicates formed a careful alliance of necessity at
first but uploading and morphing soon after tore
down any remaining social codes or racial prejudice.
Progressive in both entrepreneurial and criminal
vision, the Night Cartel emerged from the remnants
of Earth’s underworld syndicates, merging the best
qualities of each.

The Night Cartel holds legitimate hypercorp status
in certain habitats while clearly working outside the
law in more law-abiding or less corrupt regimes. The
Night Cartel is involved in a number of traditional
crime outlets: racketeering, extortion, kidnapping,
pod slavery, and prostitution. They have also adapted
well to the latest technological developments and
compete with the triads in the electronic stimulant,
drug, and nanofab piracy markets. Like the triads, the
Night Cartel sometimes operates though legitimate
hypercorp fronts.






### NINE LIVES

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Stations:** Legba (Main Belt)

</div>

This widespread network of soul-traders specializes
in acquiring, trading, and trafficking transhumans.
Their primary market lies in ego-trading: stealing
backups, forknapping, kidnapping and forced
uploading, and so on. Nine Lives are known to run
illegal infomorph-slave colonies as well as organize
pit fights using a variety of physical bodies
(biomorphs, synthmorphs, animals) loaded with
all manner of consciousnesses (transhuman, AI,
animal, etc). Only the truly desperate look towards
the syndicate to be smuggled out of a habitat or
hypercorporate indenture. Their ruthlessness in
acquiring egos has earned them a fearful reputation
among the transhuman population as well as
in infomorph societies.



### PAX FAMILAE

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Stations:** Ambelina (Venus)

</div>

Though similar to the Night Cartel in that Pax Familae
holds legal offices and outposts in several habitats
while working underground in others, the difference
between the two syndicates couldn’t be bigger. The
entire Pax Familae organization goes back to one
person, **Claudia Ambelina**, the syndicate’s founder and
matriarch. Relying excessively on cloning and forking
technologies, each individual member of the syndicate
is a descendant or variant of Claudia. Biomorphs are
cloned from Claudia’s original genetics or sexually
produced offspring (thanks to sex-switching biomods),
while egos are forks. All members are utterly loyal to
Claudia (since they all *are* Claudia) and show their
family affiliation with pride and arrogance. Individually,
each remains *slightly* but notably different, though all
are calculating and ambitious. Regular reassimilation
of forks and XP updates are used to keep each variant
aware of each of the other’s activities—once you’ve met
one version of Claudia, the others will know you.

Pax Familae engages in a wide assortment of legal,
dubious, and illegal operations, each tailored to the
needs of the particular habitat in question. Common
projects include venture capital manipulation, reputation
network gaming, financial consultation, info
brokerage, stock manipulation, banking fraud, and
loan sharking.


### PIRATES

Most pirates attack automated cargo ships and long-range
supply convoys, with the occasional raid on an
asteroid mining station, research outpost, or brinker
habitat. On rare occasions they have been known
to attack commercial cruisers to rob the wealthy or
kidnap socialites. Many pirates take advantage of
scum fleets as cover, trading with them and using their
limited maintenance capabilities. Quite a few also
make sideline profits as smugglers and/or free traders,
often utilizing connections to one of the crime
syndicates or political outcasts.




### TRIADS

<div class="stat-list">

- **Major Stations:** Qing Long (Martian Trojans)

</div>

The only major Earth syndicate to survive the Fall
almost unscathed, the triads dominate the solar sys-
tem’s underworld by their sheer membership size and
a history of centuries of economic and political infl -
ence. Having evolved into legit enterprises and small
economic consortiums already before the Fall, the
triads followed the masses of Chinese workers into
space, gaining a foothold during the early years of
colonization. After the Fall, they used their influenc
to spread to numerous habitats, taking advantage of
the disparities in wealth and restrictive refugee poli-
cies to create flourishing gray and black market enter-
prises. Part of their success lies in their continued use
of ethnic Chinese social cues to ensure their insularity.

Though numerous small triad outfits exist, each
claiming a particular station or region, there are four
large triad groups worthy of mention. Each of these
wields enough influence to engage in system-wide
criminal activities. Traditionally they operate through
small to medium-sized gangs local to a specific habitat
or use their legal outfits as a font for their endeavours.

**The 14K Triad** controls a large part of the casino
industry and various forms of illegal gambling,
betting, and rigged lotteries. Through their Galaxy
Entertainment Group, a legal casino and gambling
hypercorp, the 14K maintains tight connections to
politicians, celebrities and influential entrepreneurs in
several habitats and can afford the luxury of a private
police force, the Pai Gow (Double Hand). Using the
casino business for money laundering, they are also
heavily involved in loan sharking and credit/ID fraud.

**The Shui Fong**—though smaller than the 14K—
caters to the vices and addictions of indentured
habitat workers, miners, and other laborers, supplying
drugs, narcoalgorithms, and illegal XP, running pros-
titution rings, and arranging pit fights and gambling
tournaments. The origin of the Shui Fong’s fierc
rivalry with the 14K lies in the ruins of Earth’s pre-
Fall history, but the hatred between the two factions
was carried into space and continues to simmer.

**The Sun Yee On** once ranked second among
Earth’s biggest triads, with over 25,000 suspected
members. They profit primarily by selling cheap
copies of nanofab blueprints and rigged makers
and fabbers. Legal products are distributed through
their Wushuang Corporation, while illegal goods are
patched together by enslaved infomorphs in virtual
sweatshops in remote corners of the mesh. The Sun
Yee On’s second main profit source are fake Earth
nostalgia items, such as jewelry, documents, coins,
and other collector’s items.

**The Big Circle Gang** is the smallest of the four
triad factions with approximately 8,000 members.
They run a large part of the solar system’s drug trade,
producing organic drugs, smart drugs, and narcoalgo-
rithms of all kinds in secluded habitats or abandoned
asteroid mining and processing facilities converted
into drug labs.

## FIREWALL

Firewall has been on the forefront of the secret figh
to save transhumanity since the Fall. Firewall is an
independent network of cells and individuals recruited
from all sorts of factions, cultures, backgrounds, and
habitats. Potential new recruits are approached in
secret and told they possess skills or knowledge of use
to a clandestine network seeking to secure transhumanity’s
continued survival. Firewall’s agenda is simple: to
protect transhumanity from threats of existential scope,
regardless of whether such risks emerge from within
transhumanity or are of external, alien origin.

Firewall operatives—known as *sentinels*—are
encouraged to act independently and utilize their own
resources. Sentinels are connected by a social network
known as the Eye, which they can use to acquire help
and additional needed skills or resources. A sentinel’s
i-rep on this network indicates how much they are
trusted and will be a factor in determining what aid
they can call in. Firewall also takes care of large
expenses and logistics when necessary, such as 
ego-casting and resleeving needs. Sentinels are guaranteed
resurrection, either via cortical stack or by backup, if
they lose their lives on a Firewall op.

Sentinels are generally expected to be on-call—when
something comes up in their vicinity or that their 
particular specialty might call for, they’ll be brought in on
a job. Sentinels are usually grouped into ad hoc special
ops teams appropriate to each mission. Though many
sentinels pursue their own agendas after completing a
mission for Firewall, it is not uncommon for sentinel
teams to remain in contact, share information or
continue to work together on Firewall-related assignments
over a longer period of time.

Firewall operations are organized and managed by
*proxies*, agents who maintain Firewall’s decentralized
infrastructure. Proxies possess more information than
individual sentinels and will dispense such
information as they deem necessary to the mission,
according to each sentinel’s i-rep and need to know.
Each proxy’s means of contact, mission briefing and
overall methodologies differ greatly.

### PROMETHEANS
A prominent topic among conspiracy theorists is the
existence of a group of seed AIs calling themselves
Prometheans. Rumors of these entities predated the
Fall and occasionally flare up as some new evidence
comes to light, though such evidence is almost always
discredited soon after. According to some theories,
the Prometheans predated the TITANs and may even
have been responsible for bringing the TITANs into
existence. Others postulate that the Prometheans were
a TITAN splinter faction that broke off and attempted
to counteract the TITANs activities during the Fall.
Still others whisper that the Prometheans are not of
transhuman origin at all and are actually a digital alien
mindform that found Earth and now actively interferes
with transhuman affairs. Whether the Prometheans
are hostile, friendly, or indifferent remains a matter of
much conjecture and contention. Prominent organizations
like the Planetary Consortium discount such
rumors or otherwise remain silent.


<blockquote>

## PROJECT OZMA
\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

You won’t find this group mentioned
on the conspiracy boards—Consortium
security is too tight to allow slip-ups.
If you haven't heard of Project Ozma before,
cosider this your warning.

Project Ozma was the name of an international collaborative
SETI project before the Fall. It briefly entered public
discourse after the Fall and the discovery of the first Pandora
gate as a Planetary Consortium initiative to attempt to
discerb the whereabouts of the TITANs in the galaxy.
Shortly afterwards, however, Project Ozma dropped from view,
wiped from all public mention in innser system mesh servers.
Consortium officials simply claim that the project was
folded into other departments.

Firewall doesn’t know what Project
Ozma is, but we know they’re still
around—and they seem to have similar
interests. We’ve butted heads a few
too many times for it be a coincidence.
Perhaps they’re the Consortium’s version
of Firewall or maybe their agenda is
entirely different. I’ve heard some speculation
that they’re tasked for preparing for and
handling alien contact. All we know is that
they operate at the deep black budget level
and they have insane amounts of resources at
their beck and call. They’re also vicious as fuck,
the type to shoot first and question your
backup later. SOP if you run counter
to a Project Ozma op is to bail out fast
and stay hands off. We’ve lost dozens of
agents to them already.
