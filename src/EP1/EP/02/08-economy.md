# THE ECONOMY

Leaving aside the struggles of bands of primitives to
survive on the ruins of Earth, all of transhumanity has
at least some access to the wonders of nanotechnology.
This access is highly variable and the economic benefits
it produces can be divided into three broad 
categories—the old economy, the transitional economy,
and the new economy.

## THE OLD ECONOMY

The old economy is essentially the same sort of industrial
consumer capitalism that has been in place since
the late 19th century, a system centered on manufacturers
who create material goods and sell them to
consumers. Modern manufacturers now make their
goods in cornucopia machines instead of factories, but
the essential pattern is the same one that has existed
for over two hundred years. Due to the high level of
inefficiency and unfairness in this economic system,
poverty is relatively common. The poorest individuals
often face hunger, homelessness, lack of medical care,
and similarly dire problems.

Ordinary members of this society never have direct
access to cornucopia machines. Instead, they purchase
their goods from corporations, governments,
or wealthy individuals who control them. Some old
economy societies have planned economies, where the
corporations or the state determine what options the
citizens may choose or occasionally what goods they
must have. Others claim to have a free market, where
citizens have more options, but the residents must still
pay to obtain goods that are essentially free for the
corporations or government to produce.

In the present day, almost no one willingly lives in
old economy societies. Very few individuals even visit
such societies. The oppressive Jovian Republic holds
most of the remaining old economy societies in the
solar system. The few other surviving examples are
totalitarian regimes where the wealthy elite maintain
absolute control of all cornucopia machines and
private ownership of one is a very serious crime. Since
cornucopia machines can be used to create more
cornucopia machines, maintaining strict control over
them requires constant vigilance.

Residents of old economy societies tend to look at
the people of transitional and new economy societies
with envy, while citizens of both transitional and
new economies look upon old economy habitats
with a mixture of horror and pity. Since the Fall,
almost a third of the remaining old economy-based
habitats have transformed into transitional or new
economies by various means, often involving violent
revolution. Most social scientists predict that unless
there are further catastrophes, all but the most
repressive old economy societies are almost certain
to transform to transitional economies within
twenty to thirty years.

Old economy societies are unique in that money is
the society’s only acceptable means of exchange. While
reputation networks exist, they are informal and serve
as an unsanctioned means of exchanging favors.

## THE TRANSITIONAL ECONOMY

The transitional economy is a far more stable and
easily maintained system than the old. Transitional
economies blend old and new economies, and habitats
using this system feature both private ownership
of cornucopia machines as well as public fabbers
and makers that are freely accessible. These public
machines are strictly limited in the goods they can
produce and the raw materials for various complex
goods are also strictly regulated. Mars, Venus, and
Luna are all examples of transitional economies, as is
most of the rest of the inner system.

For the inhabitants of a transitional economy,
creating food, non-smart clothing, furniture, and
most other simple, non-formatible objects is a
trivial matter. However, the public nanofabrication
machines can only create objects that either contain
no electronics at all or contain only simple circuits
that report on the object’s condition and location.
Manufacturing any of these items requires little more
than the machine and a supply of carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, iron, aluminum, and tiny
amounts of various trace materials. All of these materials
are sufficiently abundant that acquiring them is
easy and inexpensive.

Using the elements that are freely available to all
tax-paying citizens, nanofabbers can produce a vast
array of goods like exquisite suits of silk clothing,
tables with the appearance of finely polished ebony
and mahogany, beautiful colored glass goblets, or
painted porcelain tea cups. They can also create a
gourmet dinner and a set of fine plates and cutlery on
which to eat the meal. To pay for the small amounts
of energy and resources needed to create these goods,
all inhabitants pay a small tax.

Once the usage tax has been paid, food, clothing,
furniture, and similar goods are all free. Raw materials,
old, worn-out or unwanted goods, and various waste
products are recycled into new goods. Residents of
transitional economies need never experience hunger
or any of the many other sorts of deprivation that
much of humanity faced before the mid-21st century.
Additionally, basic medical care is free in almost all
transitional economy societies, to help insure that the
populace is healthy, content, and productive.

While many goods are freely available, there are
also goods that residents must purchase from corporations,
their government, or other producers. Smart
clothing and smart furniture that can change shape,
color, and pattern, depending upon the user’s wishes,
cannot be manufactured in any of the personal 
nano-fabricators. Any goods made from highly durable
composite materials, batteries, electrically powered
devices (including many augmentations), and all
nanotechnology must be acquired in the same fashion.
These goods are considerably less common as they
require access to an unrestricted nanofabricator and/
or exotic raw materials.

Transitional economies tend to be relatively safe
places, since inhabitants cannot manufacture weapons
more dangerous than knives, clubs, or similar primitive
armaments. Everything from firearms to plasma
weapons requires restricted cornucopia machines and
exotic materials to manufacture. The proliferation of
these items is strictly controlled.

Some habitats in the outer system have transitional
economies because residents prefer the safety that
comes from centralizing control of potentially dangerous
technologies. Other habitats have transitional
economies by default, because they have limited
stocks of many of the more rare elements required
for manufacturing various complex modern technologies.
Regardless of the reason, outsiders from new
economy habitants often see them as somewhat poor
and deprived, while many residents of transitional
economies consider new economy societies both
exceptionally wealthy and somewhat frightening.

Despite these differences in perception, both economic
societies have a great deal in common. Food,
clothing, and similar goods are easily available to
all residents. An individual’s status, taste, wealth,
and reputation are measured by the kinds of clothing,
food, and furnishings they possess. While there
are a vast number of templates for different styles of
food and consumer goods, forward-thinking designers
develop new designs every month and use copy
protection on these designs to keep them from being
pirated for at least a month or two (and often longer).
As a result, for the first few months after their release,
the only people who can gain access to new designs in
clothing, tableware, food, or similar goods are those
who pay a premium to the designer to download the
templates that allow their cornucopia machine to
manufacture the item.

Since one way of defining a transitional economy
is a system where both reputation and money are in
widespread use, most have developed ways to accom-
modate both forms of payment. While residents primarily
use money for purchasing goods, purchasing
cornucopia machine templates involves rep, especially
among residents who regularly visit new economy
societies or have significant contacts there

## RESTRICTING DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES

Most societies in Eclipse Phase restrict access
to exceptionally dangerous goods, especially
military hardware. Few people living in a sealed
habitat surrounded by hard vacuum enjoy the
idea of easy access to biowar plagues or devices
that can make large holes in their habitat’s outer
hull. Though such incidents are quite rare, the
memories of horrors like the recent Branson-Vesta
disaster are still quite fresh. In that incident,
a radical bioconservative cult manufactured
several plasma bombs and accidentally destroyed
the entire habitat when their attack on the
local government caused a cascading blowout,
cracking the spinning habitat in half. More than
50,000 residents had to be resleeved and 400 permanently
died when their backups and cortical
stacks were destroyed in the explosions.

Standard procedure is to restrict access and
heavily encrypt templates needed to create
military-grade weapons and similar dangers,
though sufficiently dedicated individuals can
eventually decrypt or reverse-engineer such
designs. Even nanofabricators in anarchist habitats
may be blocked from creating such things
or at the very least will alert the local public
mesh if anyone instructs them to do so. Habitats
that possess almost no other laws regarding
possession of various objects and devices usually
have laws against weapons that can do serious
harm to the habitat.

Many dangerous technologies are specifically
designed to make use of various exceptionally
rare or transhuman-made elements, including
radioactive elements and artificially created
transuranic elements. Therefore, many habitats
will restrict access to these elements to limit the
manufacture of these weapons. Since detecting
radioactive elements is simple using standard
environmental sensors located throughout every
habitat, security authorities can easily learn when
someone has acquired significant quantities of
such elements or catch them if they attempt to
bring them on board.

## THE NEW ECONOMY

Less than forty percent of the transhuman population
lives under some version of what social scientists refer
to as the new economy. In the outer system, alterna-
tive economies are becoming increasingly rare. New
economies are much better than old or transitional
economies at supporting a decentralized populace,
which has led to more than half of all new habitats
and settlements adopting this model.

In new economy societies, individuals can freely
manufacture and use almost anything they want,
assuming they can acquire the correct templates and
raw materials. As a result, the residents’ need for food,
clothing, medical care, information access, and other
basic needs are all easily met. However, there are
still items of value that individuals work very hard
to obtain. Though these are commonly described as
“post scarcity” societies, some types of scarcity remain
very real.

In most new economy habitats, common goods
are freely available to all residents—or at least to
all residents who meet certain criteria. These criteria
usually take one of two forms: citizenship or public
works. In wealthy and prestigious habitats, free access
to all common goods is offered to residents who have
official citizenship. Citizenship can be earned in a
variety of ways, but the most common involves either
being considered a strategic asset due to some singular
expertise, performing an exceedingly valuable service
to the habitat, or working for the habitat for some
period of time. Once an individual is a citizen, the
energy, living space, and raw materials they use in the
course of their daily lives are all freely available.

In many collectivized habitats, residents are
expected to pull their weight by contributing to
ongoing public works in the habitat, typically
requiring between four and eight hours every week.
Depending on the nature of the colony, this work
may be selected by the government, the collective
syndicates that oversee the management of resources,
or by a high rep individual who controls access to
large amounts of energy and raw materials. Unless
someone has especially valuable skills, this labor is
often dull but safe work that can be done more easily
by transhumans than AIs, such as checking the habitat
for flaws and performing maintenance tasks

Assuming an individual has acquired citizenship
or put in their share of work for the collective well-being
of the station, they will have access to a supply
of energy and raw materials that allows them to use
their cornucopia machines to manufacture what
they need. Visitors are generally also allowed access,
though anyone staying long is expected to contribute
to the habitat if they don’t want to see their reputation slashed.

### VALUE AND SCARCITY IN NEW ECONOMY SOCIETIES

While basic citizenship allowances cover most
necessities and even some luxuries, this has limits.
With the allowance, individuals receive a quota
of goods and energy they can use every day. This
usage is impressively lavish by 20th century terms,
allowing residents to create a dozen suits of clothing
and provide food for half a dozen people every day.
Creating elaborate food, furniture, and tableware to
serve a party of a dozen people is within the means
of any individual. However, doing the same thing for
a party of two hundred people is outside the bounds
of the basic allowance.

Individuals who wish to exceed their basic citizenship
allowance can either use rep to obtain more
access to resources and energy or they can pool
their resources with others to accomplish their goals.
There are many goods that are fairly complex to
create—including many of the best morphs and highly
specialized and intricate pieces of gear like advanced
augmentations—that exceed the resources available in
a basic citizenship allowance.

The allowance also limits the amount of travel that
residents can easily undertake. Residents of most
new economy habitats own good quality spacesuits,
and many can use their rep to create a small and
very minimally equipped travel pod to visit a nearby
habitat. However, even the smallest actual spacecraft
are far too large and difficult to create to be available
on an ordinary citizenship allowance or even on the
amount of rep an ordinary individual can acquire in a
reasonable amount of time.

In addition to large-scale uses of resources and
difficult-to-manufacture goods, there are items that
are intrinsically scarce, such as relics of Earth and
handmade crafts. While exact copies of everything
from the Mona Lisa to a pressed daisy are exceptionally
easy to acquire, genuine physical relics of Earth
are prized possessions. The vast majority of refugees
could take nothing with them, but almost everyone
wishes to have some token to remind them of Earth. A
single dried flowe , coin, or piece of stone from Earth
can be exchanged for almost any morph or other
good that is moderately difficult to create. Actual
historical artifacts, like a famous person’s hat or autograph,
are worth far more, as are original works of
art by famous artists. Two years ago, one of the last
three remaining paintings by Leonardo da Vinci was
traded for a large and well-equipped spacecraft, and
a small piece of the Liberty Bell was traded for both
a custom-designed morph and a fully outfitted one-hectare
villa in one of the more prosperous habitats
orbiting Saturn.

While less expensive than Earth relics, handmade
goods also command a high price and are in great
demand by the wealthy. Though most people cannot
distinguish between a fine wine grown on one of the
Martian vineyards and a duplicate of the same wine
produced using an average cornucopia machine, some
connoisseurs claim they can taste the difference. There
is also much prestige to be gained by serving hand-grown
food. Hand-produced wine is a rare good that
can only be enjoyed by a few, and thus it commands
a moderately high price. In almost all cases, 
handmade goods are expensive because of their rarity and
because many people enjoy the status associated with
owning and using them.

There are three other items that are scarce and
thus quite valuable: living space, skilled sapient labor,
and novelty. The majority of transhumanity lives in
standard-sized dwelling units, which typically range
from one hundred cubic meters on smaller or poorer
habitats to two hundred cubic meters on wealthy
and prosperous habitats. Since each cubic meter of
a habitat must be manufactured and the process of
building or expanding a habitat is far from simple,
space is at a premium. The only exceptions to this
scarcity are Europa and Mars, which can be inhabited
by properly adapted morphs without the necessity of
complex life support or the danger of vacuum waiting
just outside every exterior wall. As a result, owning a
larger dwelling space in a habitat is worth a significant
amount, and large villas and private asteroids are
luxuries possessed by only the highest rep individuals.

While transhuman labor has become cheap due
to the large number of infugees who must sell their
services or indenture themselves to obtain morphs
and habitat space, skilled labor is far more expensive.
A unique custom morph design, for example, crafted
by a skilled genehacker, can cost as much as a small
spacecraft depending on how much this morph
deviates from standard models. The same is true for
everything from custom-designed clothing to complex
pieces of technology designed for a single specifi
usage. While the actual manufacturing costs of these
items is no more expensive than any other similar
item, the time and effort needed to design them can
make them exceedingly expensive.

The final commodity that is both scarce and valuable
is novelty. While anyone can drink a fine wine or
wear a wide range of designer clothing, other commodities
are kept deliberately scarce. Cutting-edge
fashion, new music, and even *haute nosh* (bold, exclu-
sive snack food designs) are harder to find because the
templates needed to manufacture them are encrypted
and cannot be copied. The copy protection used on
the templates for newly created goods automatically
expires within three years at most, and most habitats
reduce this to one year. In addition, this copy protection
is never perfect; someone always manages
to create pirated versions of these new goods within
two to six months. However, from the time templates
are created until the time that someone pirates them,
these items are only available to individuals who are
willing and able to pay for them. Popular new templates
command a good price in the new economy,
and a large number of transhumans make their living
designing and marketing such templates.

## IRREPRODUCIBLE GOODS

In an age when digital material is easily copied and
physical goods are reproducible with nanofabrication,
concepts like copyright, trademark, and intellectual
property are fighting a losing war. Despite the best
methods of encryption, DRM, and similar anti-piracy
measures, very little escapes the clutches of pirates for
long. It’s not unheard of for copies/blueprints of new
goods to be shared on pirate networks before they’re
even officially released.

In response, some manufacturers, designers, and
artists attempt to produce goods that are 
irreproducible—and thus more highly valued. Possible
approaches include transgenic living sculptures with
built-in obsolescence and terminator genes, energy art,
items made from extremely rare materials (e.g., a chair
crafted from titanium mined from the Mead crater on
the harsh Venusian surface), or intangibles such as
skilled performances.

### THE ECONOMY AND INFOMORPH REFUGEES

During the last phase of The Fall and the evacuation of
Earth, more than four hundred million refugees were
uploaded and egocast to orbital databanks throughout
the solar system. They were forced to flee Earth
without any of their possessions, even their bodies.
Instead, they became infomorphs who had nothing
beyond their minds and memories—the most destitute
group of refugees ever to exist in transhuman history.
In the years since the Fall, large numbers of these infugees
have been resleeved. Anyone with valuable skills
was first to gain a morph, followed by anyone with
friends or relatives already living in orbit who could
take responsibility for the person’s resleeving.

Those two groups accounted for only half of the
refugees. The remaining found themselves in a far more
difficult situation. Lacking either personal contacts or
vital skills, they had no one else to help them. In the
first few years, many of these infugees signed contracts
promising their labor or other services in return for
resleeving and a guarantee of some form of income
sufficient to support them. Because of the critical labor
shortages in the first five years after the Fall, another
thirty percent of the refugees managed to regain bodies
(usually cheap synthmorphs). These indentured servants
performed all manner of critical tasks, ranging
from scavenging ruined habitats for useful devices to
mining or asteroid herding. Others became servants or
bodyguards for the rich or performed less moral services
for criminal syndicates. Most took on orbital construction
jobs, helping to build the new habitats that
would eventually become their homes. Some infugees
found work performing services like data-mining, monitoring
automated factories, or other jobs that could be
done by infomorphs. After the Fall, infomorphs were
used to take over numerous tasks previously handled
by AGIs, who were no longer trusted.

Unfortunately, some infomorph refugees made bad
or unlucky deals and ended up working for years only
to find that their employer either kept finding ways to
delay or reduce the payment or vanished before they
delivered on their promise. As a result, slightly more
than twenty percent of the original infomorph refugees
remain infomorphs; some by choice, but most because
they have not been able to acquire the means to resleeve
themselves or are still working long contracts to gain
their morph. The problem with obtaining bodies for
these infugees goes beyond simply providing a new
morph for resleeving; living beings require living space
as well as a steady supply of consumables. For this
reason, many infugees have been morphed in synthetic
shells and housed in areas inhospitable to biomorphs,
such as the unenclosed portions of Venusian aerostats.
With space in short supply, the waiting list for infugees
looking for a habitat to call home is quite long.

Both the hypercorps and the Planetary Consortium
were quick to make use of this vast labor pool, especially
on Mars. Mars has large amounts of open space
and resources and is sufficiently close to habitable that
Mars-adapted morphs like the ruster are inexpensive
to create. As a result, the Planetary Consortium has
been responsible for the employment of almost half of
all remaining infomorph refugees. For the past decade,
the vast majority of infomorph refugees who want
bodies have found that indenturing themselves to the
Planetary Consortium or one of the associated hypercorps
involved in Martian terraforming is the most
reliable way to find both a morph and housing, since
both are guaranteed at the end of the contract. The
work involved is particularly diffi ult, however, and
the contracts are normally quite long. The Planetary
Consortium is also particularly adept at adding
charges that prolong indenture—though most indentures
carry five to twenty year contracts, in reality
these indentures typically last between eight and
twenty-five years; some go on even longer. This large
population of indentured servants on Mars—many
of them now free and resleeved—is becoming a force
in its own right, adhering to the Martian wilds and
rural areas and disdaining the elite hypercorp domes.
Adopting the name Barsoomians from an old Earth
fiction series, this resentful lower class is increasingly
becoming a thorn in the Planetary Consortium’s side.

Even though it is highly automated, terraforming
and agricultural work on Mars is both tedious and
physically demanding labor. Indentured employees are
regularly sent into the regions that were most affected
by the Fall. As a result, these employees occasionally
face attacks by life forms mutated by the TITANs, nanotech
war-swarms, or similar still-active and dangerous
exotic technologies. Indentured employees are not
charged for damage to or destruction of their morphs
caused by such dangers, but the experience of even
reversible death from such causes is highly traumatic.

Other refugees found that they enjoyed life as infomorphs,
reveling in complex simulspaces and otherwise
living up the virtual life. Some found work that paid for
the ability to egocast throughout the solar system. Ten
years after the Fall, there is a thriving infomorph culture.
While exact data is difficult to obtain, many researchers
believe that at least a third of all current infomorph
refugees have no plans to place themselves into a morph,
instead enjoying the freedom of virtual existence. These
infomorphs have become increasingly involved in
habitat politics, especially in the outer system; many
habitats have officials who are infomorphs. Most
researchers predict this infomorph culture will increasingly
diverge from physical cultures as time progresses.

### THE CLANKING MASSES

With so many infugees acquiring cheap synthmorph
shells—particularly cases and synths—and unable
to afford anything better, synthmorphs have become
associated with poverty throughout the solar system.
This lowest strata of the poor are often referred to as
“the clanking masses” and compose one-sixth of the
transhuman population. Most of these people strongly
desire a biomorph sleeve, even if it is only a splicer or
worker pod. Their omnipresence is now viewed with
distaste, especially in elite social circles. Even those
who have expensive, lovely, custom-designed synthetic
morphs fitted with all of the latest augmentations are
considered to be eccentrics with poor taste.

The social stigma against synthmorphs is strengthened
by the fear that, in the event of another attack
by the TITANs, their robotic shells could be rapidly
co-opted to become a deadly TITAN-controlled
army. This has led to some habitats going so far as
to actively segregate their synthmorph populations,
rationalized by the fact that shells can easily inhabit
unheated and unpressurized portions of various habitats.
This segregation and social stigma, however, has
produced the beginnings of an emergent synthmorph
culture. There are already numerous habitats where
all of the inhabitants are sleeved in synthetic shells
and conventional life support exists only for the few
visitors wearing biomorphs.
