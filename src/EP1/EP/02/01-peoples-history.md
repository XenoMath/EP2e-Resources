# A PEOPLE’S HISTORY OF AN UNFORTUNATE UNIVERSE

\[Sounds of scratching on the microphone, creaking of furniture,
the noise of a woman clearing her throat\]

What?

\[Indistinct murmuring\]

Fuck you. I do this how the fuck I want, though
it was nice of you to put me in this nice young
woman’s body.

\[Sounds of hands running along fabric\]

Does my vulgarity shock you, corporate lackey? No
matter, I’m sure you can edit it out for your proles.
Now—you asked about my book? Is it a history book
you ask? No. It is an anti-history book. I shall tell you
about the future.

\[Mumbling, questioning tone\]

What does it hold? The future, you mean?

\[Indistinct “Yes.”\]

No. I don’t think you care about the future. What
you really want to know is: will you get the future
you want? And that is an easy question to answer. No.
No, you will not get the future you want. Because you
are stupid enough to ask this stupid question about
the future.

\[Silent pause\]

I remember reading a scan of an old real print
comic once. The character in it was railing against the
imaginary people of his imaginary world, taking them
to task about their dissatisfaction with the future they
lived in. But it was really aimed at the stupid people
who wanted their stupid little futures and who were
too stupid to see that the future is now. It’s always
now. Except it isn’t anymore. The TITANs changed
that. The future is now yesterday, and last week, and
ten years ago. Especially ten years ago. But the future
is also back on poor old Earth—it’s a legacy of where
we’ve been and what has come before.

Do they teach you history on Venus, in your sealed
compounds and resort aerostats? No, don’t open
your mouth, I could really care less what they teach
you. For it is most certainly lies. I’ve lived in the inner
system. I know the rules and the deceits told in the
name of civil order and “national security.”

Nations! Ha! Even at the onset of the 21st century,
nations were starting to go into decline. It just took
everyone a while to realize they were obsolete.

Do you remember the great nations of the world?
Are you old enough to remember how they sat around
and debated whether the major climate shifts they
were creating were even real? Even when many of
them agreed that something needed to be done, none
of them stood up to do it. The leaders of the world
carried on with business as usual, secure in their
privilege, as droughts ravaged Africa and Central
Asia, Europe froze, and severe weather wreaked havoc
everywhere. People across the globe were feeling the
pinch of starvation or rampant epidemics, but the
leading nations were more concerned about the refugees
pouring over their borders and polluting their lily
white paradises with their customs and languages and
willingness to work for a pittance just to survive.

The wars over oil and energy were only worsened
by wars over the weather and water that followed.
Unstable regimes rose and fell or were pushed over
the edge, all in pursuit of precious liquids. The great
nation states transformed into fortresses, steeled
against the twin threats of the barbarians threatening
them on the outside and the masses of their poor and
dispossessed internally, all of them wanting to come
in only for a little drink.

You know, I’ve actually heard some conservatives
refer to that period as a golden age, a peak time for
the corporations and the rich. It’s certainly true that
it was a golden age for repression—and profits If you
were in that lucky fraction of a percent of the population
 who could afford it, it was certainly a good time,
but for the majority of humanity it was a time of
horrors. Global inequality was larger than ever before.
Robots were taking jobs away from human hands.

This was a time of radicalization. Failing governments
 no longer supplied people’s basic needs. The
globalized poor turned to local tribes, fundamentalist
groups, political radicals, and criminal networks for
the means to survive. Insurgent groups flourished, but
they depended on the black market to survive, and
soon their leaders were more concerned with making
money than making change.

The nation states, as always, resorted to repression.
Civil liberties were restricted and surveillance
increased. Automated weapons systems were
deployed first against guerrillas and terror cells, then
against agitators and demonstrators. I remember the
first time I saw those police drones at a demonstration
in support of a worker’s strike in Long Beach. The
drones ordered us to disperse once, only once, before
they opened fire with their “nonlethal” weapons.
Nonlethal my ass. Three people died that day and
dozens were injured. The mainstream media ignored
it even if the bloggers didn’t.

Meanwhile, the privileged elites continued to
prosper. Longevity treatments expanded lifespans—
for those who could afford it. Major crackdowns
swept up off-brand pharma and stifled bootleg
procedures by pioneering biochemists, even while
worldwide life expectancies dropped for the first time
in decades. Why extend the lives of so many poor
people when expert systems as smart as any human
could be built in a fraction of the time it would take
to educate an actual person? When robotics and
drone technologies allowed menial jobs to be turned
over to uncomplaining and unpaid labor? The rich
had their high-pricetag designer chimeric pets to keep
them company anyway.

Not all of the upper classes were wallowing in
opulence while the planet around them starved and
drowned. A few were looking ahead at the changes on
the horizon, scheming how to stake their claim. Some
of these worked to expand their dominion, building
a space elevator in sub-Saharan Africa and sending
robotic probes out to map the solar system in detail.
They even founded the fi st stations on Mars and
Luna then, more than fifty years before the Fall

The ecopocalypse wasn’t going away, however, no
matter how much those in power tried to ignore it.
Severe winters and droughts continued to pound at
us. Rising ocean levels devastated coastlines worldwide
with massive flooding A few last-ditch efforts to
undertake mega-scale geoengineering projects created
as many problems as they fixed These were viewed
with cynicism anyway, as some were thinly disguised
test runs for terraforming techniques being prepared
for offworld deployment.

It often seemed as though the eyes of the fortunate
were no longer focused on the world around them,
but rather on the heavens above. The completion
of the first space elevator and the first mass driver
on our moon kicked off a new space race and the
competition was on to stake claims around the solar
system. All this new expansion was powered by the
first mass-produced efficient fusion power plants and
the establishment of helium-3 mining enterprises.

Back on Earth, though, the hammer finally fell.
Insurgents adopted fifth generation warfare techniques,
sharing open source methods of resistance,
utilizing swarming attacks on critical systempunkts.
People crushed under years of oppression rose up in
these opportunities and smashed at the state and corporate
apparatus that had held them down. Nation
after nation fell to insurgencies manned by those who
had fought in thousands of little wars over fuel, ponds,
and bread crusts.

Most states fought back by becoming more totalitarian
and repressive, but the tide of rebellion spread
offworld as a series of outposts and stations declared
themselves in sympathy with their earthbound
compatriots and announced a manifesto for a more
humanistic approach to solar system colonization.
Numerous scientists and engineers, who had previously
worked as pawns in corporate space expan-
sions, adopted a technoprogressive stance. That’s
how the argonauts were born, you know, taking
their name from a previous group of scientists who
advised the US government and Pentagon on science
and policy called the Jasons. Faced with reprisals
from their corporate masters, a number of argonauts
defected from the hypercorps, in some cases taking
key resources and research with them, while others
went underground.

This is when the hypercorps really took off, though,
those shark-like bastards. They let the nation-states
and lumbering multinationals of old take the brunt
of the global rage and assault. They took advantage
of the chaos to slip free of the old moral and ethical
restraints on human experimentation and from the
legal purview of the nationalities that had birthed
them. They embraced the opportunities of numerous
new technologies and the drive into space. It was their
research labs that cooked up the first sentient artificia
intelligences, the fi st gengineered human clones, and
the first true uplifts: chimps and dolphins brought
into awareness as corporate experiments and slaves.

As the last of the old states became increasingly
desperate to cling to their power and land, the
hypercorps extended a helping hand. They offered
debt-bondage terms to those who were willing to sign
over their rights and humanity for a trip offworld, to
work as indentured servants on corporate colonies
and stations. Hundreds of thousands took the offer as
an alternative to the crushing poverty and chaos on
Earth. The business of resource exploitation exploded
across the solar system as stations were established
as far out as the Kuiper Belt. Voices that spoke of
respecting biodiversity and natural ecologies were
ignored as the hypercorps toiled to reshape planets
and moons to their will.

This was the state of things until about twenty
years before the Fall. Though many of the old
oppressor states had been struck down, new ones arose, and
the various global insurgencies oscillated between
making radical changes and falling into the same
old tribal warfare traps. Reactionary religious and
political forces on Earth also railed against the 
hypercorps’ agenda, resulting in some terrorist attacks and
sabotage strikes and culminating in a failed attempt
to disable the space elevator by an Islamist suicide
cell. The hypercorps were quick to retaliate, ordering
an orbital bombardment using high-density objects
against the headquarters and compounds of several
key opposition leaders. Though effective in
decapitating several terrorist networks, the mass destruction
sparked outrage against the hypercorps, creating a
deeper rift between Earth and offworld interests.

The hypercorps remained out of reach, however,
though they were not completely immune from
Earth’s troubles. The workers and colonists brought
from Earth transported many of their ethnic, political,
and socio-tribal grudges with them, leading to
several outbreaks of violence in habitats and orbital
stations. Some also harbored allegiances opposed
to hypercorp interests, illustrated by isolated acts
of preservationist sabotage and religious terrorist
attacks. Various criminal networks also came along
for the ride, expanding their black markets and vice
trades wherever humans went.

As the hypercorps expanded, so too did their political
opponents: the anarchists, socialists, argonauts
and others who worked diligently to establish their
own independent presence, mostly in the outer system,
further from hypercorp reach. The hypercorps even
contributed to this growth by sending their criminals
and undesirable elements into exile beyond Mars.

Both sides invested heavily in research and new
technologies. Advances in biotech, nanotech, AI, and
cognitive science were now moving so rapidly that
major breakthroughs were made on a yearly basis.
Developments in one field created a recursive boost
in the others, creating a feedback loop that spawned
immense technological improvements. Offworld,
genetic modifications were widely adopted, and new
transhuman adaptations became a common sight.
Sapient AIs were born, equivalent to humans in intelligence,
sparking controversies over their use and rights
as persons. We even created new synthetic life forms
that were part biological and part robotic. Despite
some being so repulsed by this development that they
dubbed these new types of beings “pod people,” it certainly
didn’t stop pods from being rapidly absorbed
into corporate workforces and brothels, nor did many
people care enough to support claims that, as sapient
beings, pods should have their own civil rights.

Two breakthroughs in this period deserve specifi
mention, not least because of their impact on our
human—now transhuman—society. The development
of the first nanotech assemblers signaled a paradigm
shift for economics. Available only to the upper
strata of the hypercorps at first these elites jealously
guarded these machines, capable of building almost
anything from the atoms up. They placed all sorts of
restrictions on their usage and availability, claiming
that the capability to construct drugs, weapons, or
other restricted items was a security risk that required
them to be strictly controlled. Open source advocates
promptly set to work undermining blueprint controls
and seeding their own open source designs, of course.
Likewise, within months, criminals and anarchists
liberated their own assemblers, and suddenly an
economic conflict was born. Some were put to use
feeding the black market trade, while others were
used to establish habitats and colonies with 
post-scarcity economies that no longer relied on wealth,
property, or greed.

At the same time came the ability to map the human
brain and digitally emulate the mind and memories
made “uploading” possible—followed closely by
the ability to download back into a separate human
brain or cyberbrain. The already long-lived hypercorp
masters no longer had to fear death by accident or
injury. This technology also made its way into the
hands of others, despite the costs. Experimentation
with other bodies—both biological and synthetic—became
a new playground for culture. And let’s not
forget those who willingly shook off the shackles of
the flesh to experience the virtual life and dive deep
into their own dreamscape realities.

While we all enjoyed our new toys, though, Earth,
poor Earth, continued to die a slow death. I can still
recall the speculation that it might take centuries for
the planet to totally slide into ecological devastation.
It was frustrating, everywhere you turned it seemed
that someone was lamenting the state of the motherworld,
but no one wanted to do anything. It was too
expensive, or too far away, or too dangerous. We all
have blood on our hands from that time. We stood
by and watched from our places in orbit as the world
burned around our brothers and sisters. We thought
we had time, we thought the world was slowly dying
and that we could find the cure. We didn’t plan on
the TITANs.

We all remember the Fall. It was only ten years
ago, but I never cease to be amazed at how confused
people’s memories are of that time. Part of that is
propaganda perpetuated by people like you, of course,
and part of it is that most of us are afraid to really
look back and examine how we humans managed to
fuck it up so badly.

We like to pretend that the TITANs exploded on
the scene, wrecked up the place, and then disappeared
as quickly as they appeared. The truth, as always, is
more complex. We claim to know that the TITANs
somehow evolved by accident from a military netwar
system, or so the theory goes. That is what their name
means: an acronym for Total Information Tactical
Awareness Networks. No one knows for sure where
these first seed AIs came from, though—or if they do,
they’re keeping quiet. Perhaps the TITANs were intentionally
designed to be a recursively improving, self-aware
digital intelligence. Perhaps the military boffin
thought they could keep such an intelligence under
their control and that it would give them the edge
they needed. Perhaps there was only one at first and
it quickly created hundreds if not thousands of copies
of itself. No one even seems to know how many of
them there were.

According to the written history—vetted by the
hypercorps, natch—we now know that the TITANs
took several days after they “woke up” to scan the
world around them, to learn about us. In their initial
stage they were relatively benign, leeching network
power and resources only where there was enough to
spare and extending their senses beyond their cradle
on Earth. Perhaps they were absorbing everything
they could to understand us. Perhaps they were indifferent.
Or maybe they really were planning to destroy
us, as the vids all say.

I remember this time. I remember that when this
new round of conflicts re-ignited on Earth, there
was no word of anything about seed AIs or TITANs.
For months and months, it was a simple escalation
of hostilities. It started with claims of netwar operations
and major intrusions, sparking some alarm and
retaliatory attacks. Aggressive stances led to incriminations,
then border conflicts and raids, followed by
missile strikes and outright hostilities. Old grudges
and sleeping enemies suddenly awoke and turned
their renewed wrath against old foes. Brush wars,
corporate rivalries, and ideological disputes flared up
as insurgencies and rebellions were suddenly everywhere.
At the time, it seemed like a not-so-unusual
spate of violence had taken a drastic turn and was
rapidly spiraling out of control.

According to the party line, this was all a carefully
concerted effort, the first stage in the TITANs plans.
Perhaps it was, though I remember some military
officials once claiming that the TITANs were brought
online because of this violence and not before then—
an opinion that was quickly silenced. Then again,
maybe we really were played—played by greater intel-
ligences who could barely be bothered to deal with
us themselves when they knew we were more than
willing to murder and annihilate each other.

When the first reports of strange automatic factories
cranking out large numbers of robotic weapons
systems broke, no one knew who to blame, but clearly
something was wrong. This was a turning point, a
chance for transhumanity to realize that we collectively
faced a new enemy, but the finger-pointing and
direct conflict continued. Even when the first open
attacks by the TITANs came in earnest, crashing
major systems, taking control of critical infrastructures,
and wreaking havoc and destruction, we treated
it as a new front in the war and never stopped taking
shots at each other.

There is still debate over whether we should have
tried to talk to the TITANs, whether they would have
been willing to listen to us, whether they even saw us
as something more than we see rats and roaches and
other forms of vermin. But it’s all academic. The fact
is we didn’t. The people who made the decisions, the
ones who had to put it all on the line at the time, saw
the TITANs as a threat. And they acted accordingly,
trying to purge them from their systems or capture
them for future study.

The philosopher Thomas Hobbes once spoke of the
war of all against all. Whatever he imagined could not
have been anything close to the conflict ignited by the
TITANs. We killed ourselves by the millions, wielding
the nuclear fire and the silent death of bioplagues
indiscriminately. Among this carnage walked the
TITANs, taking control of our machines as though
we were children, harvesting millions of minds with
forced uploads for unknown purposes. Every strike
we launched against the TITANs was met with untold
disaster and ruin, all our artifice and devices turned
against us in our moment of need.

The Fall was a horror. Factories sprang up like a
blight in the most ravaged and deserted places on
Earth, pumping out legions of dread war machines.
Advanced nanoswarms—far beyond our own capabilities—infested
everywhere, mutating to deal with
any threat they encountered. Biological nanoviruses
ripped through human populations, inflicting irreversible
neurological damage. Potent infowar worms
penetrated even hardened systems, shredding our
crucial networks with ease. Prisoner populations were
rounded up for forced mind emulations, suffering a
luckier fate than those who were merely decapitated
by head-collecting drones or pierced by robots with
neuro-scanning proboscises. Neuropathic viruses
turned some humans into pawns of the TITANs,
turning them against the rest of us. Other reports
spoke of strange, alien happenings and unimaginable
terrors. We found ourselves fighting a rearguard
action against coming extinction. The plot of a
hundred novels and movies was made manifest in our
lifetimes, the doom of transhumanity at the hands of
the machines.

For over a year they stalked and destroyed us.
There seemed to be no hurry on their part to bring us
to an end, and why would there have been? Nothing
we did affected them. They were data and information,
they were thought and impulse, they were everywhere
and nowhere, and there was nothing we could do that
they could not turn back against us. Their influence
spread outward from Earth, with outbreaks in orbit,
on Luna, Mars, and many other places. Everywhere
we had a foothold, the TITANs followed.

Perhaps you remember that point when it became
clear that transhumanity might not survive. I do.
Millions must have seen the signs. And so the great
diaspora began, the teeming masses doing whatever
they could to flee Earth. Ships were diverted, even
built, to help people escape. Those who could not buy
their way off the planet did their best to send their
digital backups, in the dim hope they could acquire a
new body. Perhaps one in ten escaped.

You might hear that we banded together to stop
the threat, that in our darkest hour we forgave
ancient grudges and simmering hatreds in the face
of extinction. That would be a lie in the face of the
ten thousand shot down over Buenos Aires by North
American forces as they sought to escape or the compromising
of network security on over two dozen
habitats in Lagrange orbits by corporate competitors
as their rivals strove to fight off a TITANs attack. We
were just as gleeful to destroy ourselves.

Then, as quickly as they appeared, the TITANs
vanished. Over the course of a week, the attacks and
disturbances trailed off and then stopped but for an
occasional outbreak. The retributions and attacks by
our own kind continued for a few more months, but
the damage we did to ourselves was nothing compared
to what the TITANs had done.

In the aftermath, we stood among the smoking
ruins of transhumanity and surveyed all that had been
lost. Of all the billions that existed before the Fall,
fewer than one in every sixteen survived, and of those
fewer still retained a corporeal form. Nevertheless,
the surviving habitats and stations were overcrowded,
with tensions high. Vast numbers of infugees circulated
online, as there were simply not enough bodies
on hand to accommodate them all. Some were placed
in permanent storage, where they remain forgotten.
Others were shunted into virtual reality, given no
choice but to live their lives in simulated environments.
A lucky few were given the chance to work
as indentured servants, often to build new habitats,
working on the promise of a body of their own
someday. You’ve no doubt seen them, working in
cheap mass-produced synthmorph bodies in menial
or dangerous tasks, segregated from the rest of us.

Those left dead or bereft of a body were the least
of our problems. Our war with the TITANs had left
the Earth a smoking, irradiated, toxic wasteland still
populated by dangerous machines and plagues. The
newly formed Planetary Consortium, composed of
hypercorp interests among the Martian and Lunar
colonies, placed Earth and the space around it under
quarantine. The official reason is that it’s for safety
reasons, allegedly to keep any remaining threats from
escaping Earth’s confines. Or perhaps we could not
stand to look at our homeworld in such a state and
face what we had done to ourselves.

Even now, ten years later, we are told that the Earth
is dangerous, that it holds risks and surprises. That’s
partly true, I believe—there are surprises alright, but
the Planetary Consortium wants them all for itself.

\[Rustling noises, murmurs\]

Of course I’m talking about a Pandora gate. The
one the TITANs left behind on Saturn’s moon was
just the first You’re a fool if you think that there are
only fi e in the entire system. I’d be willing to bet
nearly anything that there’s one down there on dear
old Earth.

Have you ever seen a gate? No? Of course not. The
hypercorps keep them locked down. Not like out
in the wild, wild outer system. Sure, the Gatekeeper
Corp lets anyone with a death wish and the minimum
training take a jaunt through the original on Pandora,
but if you’re lucky enough to come back, they own
everything you find on the other side. I suppose it’s
the chance for a certain type of adrenaline junkie “to
boldly go” and all that nonsense.

The extrasolar colonies—now, those are an all new
frontier. You inner system types are so predictable
with your rush to colonize and expand and own
everything, as if the universe is just there for your
rich overlords to claim for themselves. I expect your
extrasolar colonies are expanding quite nicely, given
the sheer number of poor debt-conscripted souls
you toss through. You probably have grand schemes
of building galactic empires. Us. Transhumanity. A
galactic civilization.

Well, galactic squatters at least. That was made
clear when the solemn crossing guards of the cosmos
showed up and issued us a warning that we were
dabbling in Things What Ought Not To Have Been.
Maybe the Factors are telling us the truth, maybe
they are acting as ambassadors for a collection of
spacefaring alien species that want to warn us away
from Forbidden Technology—y’know, the technology
we’ve already been burned by and of course have
no plans to actually abandon. Think about the Two
Commandments they have given us: thou shalt not
create self-improving AI, and thou shalt not use the
Pandora gates. Oops. Do you think they know? About
what happened with the TITANs? That even we don’t
know where they went and that we’re kind of afraid
to find out? Surely they know that we’ve been using
the gates and have spread beyond our little backwater,
and maybe that’s their real fear. But why do we even
listen to what some highly evolved slime mold tells us
to do anyway?

Taking risks, that’s the price of progress, no? Let’s
face it, we need some hope. We need a new Earth to
replace the one we destroyed, a place where we can go
and breed like rabbits and fuck it all up over and over
again. We need to know that we can expand beyond
this solar system, because right now it’s feeling a little
confining, like we could be easily trapped and wiped
out if the TITANs ever return. We need to know that
we have a future. We need to know that we can make
it through our own efforts. That we won’t do ourselves
in on our own.

The Lost proved that. It was a noble objective, to
speed a new generation of children to adulthood, but
the process was flawed Taking force-grown clones,
raising them in VR, and then dumping them into adult
bodies after they’ve only been alive for a few years
of objective time—but over eighteen years of their
subjective time? An entire childhood, having only
each other and AIs for company. It’s enough to fuck
anyone up. It was a grand experiment, but it failed,
and now we have another reminder of our failures
living among us.

That’s us, in all our glory. Ten years after the Fall
and we remain a broken, squabbling mess, jailed by
slime molds, beaten by uppity software, and yet our
own worst enemies. Spreading out from a home we
don’t even have any more. Our numbers reduced and
dwindling further with each passing day. Who will
save us? We don’t even want to save ourselves most of
the time. Or so it seems.

But if we don’t, there’s no future. And I, for one,
have not lived this fucking long to give up now. You,
me, we’re effectively immortal. The entire galaxy is
waiting out there for us. We’d be stupid not to go see it.
