# KEEPING THE PEACE

Each habitat is responsible for dealing with its
internal affairs. As a result, standards of justice
vary widely from the oppressive police state of the
Jovian Junta to the free market judicial courts of the
Extropians in the belt to the community justice policies
of the anarchists out beyond Saturn. Travelers
are strongly encouraged to check up on the legalities
and policies of stations they are visiting so as
to avoid unfortunate incidents, though muses are
generally quite good about maintaining awareness
of local conditions so that they can warn their users
before straying into gray or illegal territory.

In the inner system, standards of justice and law
enforcement tend to be uniform and very familiar to
the majority of the population that lived on Earth
prior to the Fall, where most nations had relatively
similar arrangements. Across the entire solar system,
similar policies can be found. Though local laws may
differ, there is widespread respect for the idea that
punishments for religious or ideologically based laws
only apply to residents. Visitors who violate such
restrictions or other minor laws are simply deported
to their home and forbidden to return. Standards of
evidence for criminal investigations are also common.
Modern forensic technology makes collecting and
analyzing DNA and other trace evidence an exceptionally
swift and easy process. Likewise, with almost
all habitats having what amounts to total surveillance
of all public places, any potential offenses committed
there can be carefully analyzed.

Standards of privacy vary widely from one habitat
to another, so during emergencies or crime investigations,
law enforcement officials may or may not have
total access to detailed recordings of the events in any
portion of the habitat including data from sensors in
private dwellings. In some stations, law enforcement
officials can compel everyone who might have been
present during an alleged crime to provide downloads
of their sensory experiences from the time of the crime.
While individuals can edit their memories, discrepan-
cies between various people’s sensory recordings are
just another form of evidence. Requiring sensory
downloads from witnesses and suspects is common
practice in habitats controlled by the Planetary
Consortium, the Jovian Republic, and most hypercorps.
However, in most habitats in the outer system,
law enforcement officials have no access to such
records and can only compel sensory recordings from
people who have been charged with serious crimes.

The power of modern forensics is such that a
sufficiently careful examination of people and
places can often determine the nature of a crime
and the perpetrator(s) with relative ease. Decisions
of innocence or guilt rarely rely upon suppositions,
circumstantial evidence, eyewitness testimony or
any of the other notoriously unreliable forms of
evidence common in past centuries. The best way for
someone to avoid being convicted of a crime is to
either prevent anyone from learning about the crime
or to make certain that no one suspects them as the
perpetrator. Once someone guilty of a crime becomes
a suspect, there is a very significant chance that law
enforcement officers will be able to uncover reliable
evidence connecting them to the crime. However, if
there is no obvious evidence connecting a specifi
suspect to a crime, the criminal has a greater chance
of escaping discovery.

## LAW ENFORCEMENT

Law enforcement in the solar system consists of a
vast patchwork of separate jurisdictions, occasion-
ally united by various treaties. Most habitats have
signed the Treaty of Uniform Security that requires
either extradition or on-site trial of criminals who are
accused of especially serious crimes such as attempted
habitat destruction, use of incapacitating infoware
(including basilisk hack attacks), or any attempt to aid
the agents of the TITANs in taking over or destroying
a habitat. Only the Jovian Junta and a few especially
antisocial or anarchic habitats have not signed this
treaty, but many habitats in the outer system maintain
the right to try offenders accused by other habitats
rather than extraditing them. Most habitats also
require a significant amount of evidence before they
are willing to extradite one of their residents.

Outside the Treaty of Uniform Security, there is
nothing remotely resembling a uniform code of justice
and no widely recognized police force. Instead, each
habitat or cluster maintains their own legal code and
cadre of law enforcement officers In most areas, law
enforcement is a respected and honorable profession
paid for by the government, but in a few, the only
options are private security agencies that only protect
individuals who subscribe to their services. Among the
anarchists and scum, residents are largely responsible
for their own protection, which means they may be
constantly armed when in public (depending on local
conditions). Depending on the stations, the most
someone who is the victim of a crime can do may be
to go after their attacker or post a bounty. In others,
mechanisms exist for community or collective problem-
solving that often involve assembling an ad-hoc group-
ing of peers to assess the situation, offer non-biased
judgment, and sometimes pursue collective action.

The only widely accepted law enforcement officers
that attempt to maintain jurisdiction across the
solar system are bonded investigators and security
consultants from companies such as Medusan Shield
or Direct Action. Both organizations have contracts
with various hypercorps and inner system stations to
provide security. However, in the outer system and in
other regions not controlled (directly or indirectly) by
the hypercorps, the status of these officers is far more
tenuous. In habitats that do not have security contracts
with their organization, the best these agents
can do is act as bounty hunters.

Due to extensive stories of excesses in the inner
system, many colonies frown on freelance bounty
hunters—often referred to as *ego hunters*—and may
ban them entirely. Others allow agents from licensed
security hypercorps to act as ego hunters, but forbid
them from extraditing or otherwise restraining or
punishing the criminals they are pursuing. Instead,
agents are required to turn over evidence so that the
habitat’s own judicial system may hold a trial, in
which case a convicted person may be remanded to
the agent’s custody. Law enforcement officers experience
similar difficulties attempting to apprehend a
suspect who has fled to another habitat

Closely allied habitats in the outer system usually
allow full or at least limited legal powers to visiting
law enforcement officers from their allies. There are
also various small private security organizations that
work closely with local law enforcement offices to
provide inter-habitat security between colonies that
are not closely allied. The members of these organizations
attempt to maintain sufficiently high rep to earn
the respect of all the habitats with which they work.
They act as both bounty hunters and unbiased investigators
in situations that can sometimes involve multiple
legal systems. Most of these security companies
are located in the outer system and their jurisdiction
tends to be limited to a single region, like the middle
belt or the Saturn system. Organizations that attempt
to grow larger usually come into direct competition
with larger hypercorps such as Medusan Shield and
Direct Action and are subsequently either bought out
or undercut and discredited.

Bounty hunters and private investigators are also
available on many autonomist habitats, some of
whom are highly reliable. Others are known for their
extreme moral and ethical flexibilit , especially if the
pay is sufficiently high. On some stations and scum
ships, these private contractors can be hired to simply
go on board and abduct or execute a resident as long
as this person has a low enough rep. Attempting
to abduct or kill a respected member of the community,
however, rapidly earns the ire of the entire
habitat. The various small-scale or private security
organizations from the outer system can sometimes
pursue subjects to habitats controlled by the various
hypercorps or the Planetary Consortium. Doing so
requires background checks, security screenings, and
often moderately large payments.

### PUNISHMENT

Among the autonomist colonies, forced exile or repaying
the victim with an equitable amount of goods or
labor are the principle punishments for all but the most
heinous crimes (those being attempted mass murder,
habitat destruction, attempting to create seed AIs or
similarly extreme actions). In the collectivist anarchist
habitats, antisocial behavior typically involves expulsion
or reputation penalties, though solutions that
involve making amends and rehabilitation are often
pursued over standard punishments. At the other end of
the spectrum, people convicted of more serious crimes
in the most violent and lawless habitats are executed
and all of their known backups destroyed. In many
others, exceedingly serious crimes are usually dealt with
by giving the criminal a choice of forced uploading into
a humanely outfitted but isolated computer prison or
mandatory personality modification—assuming that
someone has not simply killed the criminal before
they were brought to justice (such killings are generally
treated as matters of self-defense). Mandatory
personality modifications are generally limited to the
absolute minimum necessary to prevent the individual
from repeating similar crimes.

At the other extreme, punishments in hypercorp-controlled
habitats and settlements controlled by the
Planetary Consortium range from fines paid in either
money or labor to periods of involuntary indentured
servitude ranging from several months to many years.
Violent crimes, especially ones threatening either
important hypercorp employees or the habitat as a
whole, also result in mandatory personality modifiction.
Such modifications often include the creation of a
strong sense of loyalty and obedience to the hypercorp.

Punishments are even more draconic in the Jovian
Republic, where permanent execution and the destruction
of all backups is the most common punishment
for serious crimes against the leaders or large groups
of the populace. Since the rulers of the Republic
are strong bioconservatives, personality editing and
forced uploading are rarely used. Forced indenture is
very common, however, as are more standard forms of
imprisonment. The Republic is one of the last places
in the solar system that has physical prisons.

The vast majority of other habitats fall somewhere
between these extremes. Punishments for non-violent
crimes consist of enforced repayment, where the
offender must work off a debt to their victim(s) or
face more serious punishments. Instead of enforced
indenture, offenders usually must only work between
five and twenty hours a week for their victims and
only need to do so until the crime has been suitably
repaid. The typical repayment is between two and
three times the value of the good or service taken
from the victim.
