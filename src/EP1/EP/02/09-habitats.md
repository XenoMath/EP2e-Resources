# HABITATS

With Earth now uninhabitable, transhumanity survives
in a variety of offworld habitats. There are two
major types of these habitats: settlements on planets
or large moons, such as those on Luna, Mars, Venus,
Europa, or Titan, and space habitats that are built on
or near an asteroid or other useful source of raw materials.
Most of these space habitats spin themselves to
provide gravity, with Earth and Mars gravity being
the two most common choices. There are also a large
number of zero-g or microgravity habitats, consisting
of either non-spinning habitats or stations built into
small asteroids or moons.

## PLANETARY SETTLEMENTS

The Martian and Lunar city-states and other planetary
settlements contain environments most familiar
to refugees from Earth. This similarity is one reason
that two-thirds of all infomorph refugees live on
Mars, Luna, or Titan. The exact type of settlements
depends on the planet or moon on which they are
located, with some being far more similar to Earth
cities than others. Most Lunar settlements, like those
on Ganymede, Mercury, Titan, and Callisto, consist
of a network of subsurface tunnels and chambers
excavated with plasma drills. These tunnel settlements
differ slightly from one world to the next. In
most of these tunnel cities, the floors of all open
areas and many dwellings are composed of genetically
modified grass designed for both comfort and
durability. Light panels cover the ceiling and provide
bright full-spectrum lighting.

A few of these buried cities further enhance their
natural appearance with trees and, in some cases,
specially engineered ecosystems, in both public areas
and private dwellings. A few of these urban tunnel
forests and jungles are home to numerous flowering
vines and bright tropical butterflies In a small
number of settlements on both Titan and Luna, colonies
of small monkeys and parrots with metabolisms
and habits modified for modern ideas of cleanliness
and sanitation thrive, giving some of these tunnel
cities the feel of a buried jungle.

All of the older or more prosperous tunnel cities
also contain large open areas that are typically
between one and twenty hectares, with ceilings at
least ten meters high. Some are parks, others are
public plazas, but all offer the residents of the tunnel
cities a chance to experience open spaces. Also,
with the exception of Mercury, all of these tunnel
cities are on moons where gravity is no more than
one-sixth of a g. Some of these open spaces are constructed
with roofs between thirty and one hundred
meters high and are designed so that residents can
use them for flying by strapping on a pair of specially
designed wings.

The cloud cities of Venus are among the most
unusual habitats in the solar system. Their exotic
nature is enhanced by the chance to observe the many
recently introduced floating and flying life forms
modified to live in the clouds. Though located almost
fifty kilometers above the most deadly environment in
the solar system, life in these cloud cities is among the
most Earth-like anywhere in the solar system, with
gravity, temperatures, and atmospheric pressure all
being very near normal Earth levels.

By contrast, the settlements on Mars look the most
like the cities of lost Earth, built on the surface rather
than underground or in the skies. Some of the more
recent settlements are designed for use by inhabitants
in ruster morphs or synthmorphs and feature no life
support. Older Martian cities and other settlements
are typically covered with low domes of flexible 
poly-carbonate and filled with a completely breathable, if
somewhat low pressure, atmosphere. Some, however,
are collections of sealed skyscrapers, connected by
skywalks and tunnels. If current terraforming efforts
continue on schedule, the last sealed Martian cities
will be opened to an atmosphere breathable by standard
biomorphs within sixty years.

The most unusual planetary settlements are the
ocean cities of Europa. These are among the most
exotic locations in the entire solar system and are
quite disorienting for individuals not used to
underwater living. From a distance, most appear to be
complex Christmas tree ornaments hanging down one
hundred meters or more below the ice crust above. A
few are built deeper, plunging under the icy surface
near the various hydrothermal vents that host the
native Europan life clusters.

Many of the residents of the Europan cities find
them familiar because they previously lived in one
of the underwater cities on Earth and so were used
to both the conditions and to living in an aquatic-adapted
body. Europan cities all contain sealed
buildings with normal atmosphere, both because
some activities work best in air instead of water and
because the cities often host visitors without gills.
However, these regions make up only ten percent
or so of most of these cities. The remainder looks
vaguely similar to many zero-g habitats, except that
the structures are considerably sturdier and are
located underwater. Buildings are designed to be
accessible in all three dimensions, so going from one
floor to another usually involves swimming out a
large opening in the wall and down a level. In almost
all of these aquatic cities, large fusion generators heat
the surrounding water, so that the entire city exists
in a region of water that is far warmer than the sur-
rounding frigid Europan sea.

## SPACE HABITATS

With the exception of the private habitats of the
wealthy and powerful described below, the vast
majority of space habitats hold between twentyfive
hundred and one million inhabitants. Almost
two-thirds of these habitats were built during the
first seven years after the Fall, when huge portions
of the system’s surviving infrastructure were used
to create habitats suitable for hundreds of millions
of infugees.

During this era, several thousand torus habitats
and cluster colonies were created throughout the
solar system. Many of these habitats were created
by automated mining machinery that had been
repurposed to create colonies. Due to the limitations
of these automated mining rigs, most these habitats
were small, holding between one thousand and one
hundred thousand inhabitants. Twenty percent of
the system’s inhabitants live in such habitats. During
the past decade, various small organizations, cults,
and subcultures have left the larger habitats they
lived in and created their own small habitats, few
of which were designed to hold more than ten thousand residents.

The development of the new nanotech Hamilton
cylinders has lead to a new interest in large habitats
and in habitats that can easily expand in size
to accommodate an increasing population. The
expense and difficulty involved in expanding existing
habitats or building new ones is one of the principle
reasons that more than forty million infomorph refugees
still do not posses morphs. Although none of
the existing Hamilton cylinders has finished growing,
they are both highly regarded by their residents. This
same technology is also likely to produce a lowcost
method for creating small habitats, where the
creators merely need to seed an asteroid with the
appropriate advanced nanotech generators and wait
a few months.

### SCUM BARGES

At the opposite extreme from the Hamilton cylinders
are the infamous scum barges. Most are
spacecraft built before or during the Fall that were
used to help with the early stages of the evacuation,
ferrying people away from the doomed Earth. Many
of these refugee ships were unable to find anywhere
to unload their transhuman cargo, becoming a sort
of permanent traveling refugee camp, sometimes
succumbing to mutinies. They eventually joined up
with pre-existing scum ships and swarms, adopting
their nomadic, free-wheeling, anarchistic lifestyle.
In contrast to egocasting or the faster and more 
efficient fusion drive ships, so-called scum barges offer
a floating city alternative to space travel. These
ships function as roving black markets and carnivals
of the bizarre—lawless zones where anyone can find
whatever they want or need for the right rep or price.

Most scum barges have fusion-powered plasma drives
and hold between two hunder and five thousand
inhabitants. The worst barges are exceptionally
overcrowded, with aging life-support systems 
struggling to maintain a breathable (but still
foul-smelling) atmosphere under the strain of too
many passengers. The larger and more prosperous
scum barges are often fitted with various modern
conveniences, including large cornucopia machines
and vast stores of pirated manufacturing templates.
Some are thriving utopianist enclaves, while others
are mobile dens of smugglers and thieves that would
have been destroyed long ago except for the fact that
large and powerful organizations find their existence
occasionally useful. Living conditions on the scum
barges range from overcrowded refugee camps or
thriving, egalitarian anarchist enclaves to relatively
modern habitats outfitted in barbaric splendor by
successful organized crime gangs.


## A DIVERSITY OF FLOATING WORLDS

The use of cornucopia machines and smart materials
means that the interiors of all but the poorest and
most destitute habitats can be reshaped according
to the whims of their inhabitants. When the number
of inhabitants is small enough or their aesthetics
are uniform enough to all share the same tastes, the
results can be both unique and strange. Large-scale
fads occasionally sweep through even the largest and
most cosmopolitan habitats, making some of the
bigger colonies almost as odd.

Several habitats closely resemble terrestrial jungles,
with an entire rainforest canopy growing from the
slowly rotating outer shell and all dwellings and
pieces of high technology nestled in the branches
or hollows of these vast gene-engineered trees. In
these living marvels, genetically engineered monkeys,
iguanas, and tree sloths wander amidst the inhabitants—some
of these creatures are wild animals,
while others are controlled by AI servitors and act
as maintenance or observation drones. Some habitats
resemble other scenes from old Earth, including
more than a dozen water-filled habitats hosting some
of the aquatic inhabitants of the now-destroyed
underwater cities. In most of these marine habitats,
the actual buildings are either placed amidst a living
coral reef filled with fish and other creatures or are
actually built into the coral reef itself. There are
many other habitats duplicating other environments,
such as Afrique—a large Cole habitat with a population
of two hundred thousand, where the habitat is
made to resemble the African savanna. In Afrique,
the two ends of the habitat are shaped into snowcapped
mountains, and the inhabitants mostly live in
several large cities built in the savannah.

While nostalgia for Earth is a powerful force in
habitat design, there are many other options. A few
exotic habitats resemble fantastic cities from various
vid games or older forms of entertainment, including
a handful of small and eccentric habitats where
the inhabitants all appear as strange humanoid alien
beings. In many, the inhabitants have cosmetically
modified themselves to fit in with the setting.

One of the most common differences between
small and large habitats is that the residents of
smaller stations often share a common ideology or
sense of aesthetics and so are far more eccentric.
Some of the more unusual small habitats include
dimly lit, spooky landscapes filled with perpetually
leafless trees or thick, continually regenerating
cobwebs, and other similar macabre touches. Others
are gleaming colonies of shining citadels made from
quartz and steel. Some are huge interconnected
arcologies where any sort of personal privacy is rare,
while in others every family or even every person has
a separate dwelling that is rarely seen by outsiders.
Since the populations of these stations are relatively
small and the vast majority are not major economic
centers, travel to and from these smaller habitats is
infrequent, which further increases their insularity
and idiosyncrasies.

## THE LARGEST HABITATS

Extropia, the huge Martian city-states, and some of
the largest Lunar stations hold between one million
and twenty million inhabitants. There are many
smaller settlements containing between one hundred
thousand and one million residents. These habitats
are considerably less idiosyncratic and exotic than
the smaller colonies. Almost all contain a cosmopolitan
and diverse population from a wide variety
of subcultures. Because of this diversity and the
difficulty of forming any sort of consensus with a
large population, these settlements tend to be reminiscent
of the cities of Earth. All of them have their
own unique character and feel, but the differences
between one habitat and another are rarely overwhelming.
In addition, all of these stations are large
enough to hold offices for all of the major hypercorps,
who further promote uniformity by providing
the same services from identical hypercorp offices
Since most of these habitats are major centers of
commerce, travel between them is frequent, so there
are various facilities for travelers such as hotels and
sports clubs that help reduce the disorientation of
travel by offering identical experiences, regardless of
their location.

## MICROGRAVITY HABITATS

Zero-g habitats are very different from those that
use rotational gravity. Most consist of networks
of tunnels drilled through an asteroid—similar to
the tunnel cities of Luna and Titan—but some are
considerably more exotic. Like most other habitats,
almost all microgravity colonies are built in, on, or
next to one or more asteroids containing a large
amount of useful raw materials. They typically
feature a gravity less than 0.01 g that has very little
effect on the daily lives of the inhabitants. Near-weightless
environments allow for some interesting
and unusual habitat designs as there is no up or
down, enabling the creation of structures that would
be too fragile even in low gravity. The habitats of
[*Nova York*](./11-system-gazeteer.md#nova-york-metis) and 
[Nguyen’s Compact](./11-system-gazeteer.md#epimethus-and-janus-twelve-commons)
are both examples of this, among many others.

## PRIVATE HABITATS

The most rare and exotic of all of the types of habitats
are the luxurious private ones owned by exceedingly
wealthy or high-rep individuals. Most private habitats
are small but still give each of the residents several
thousand cubic meters of personal space.

A typical private habitat is either a cylinder one
hundred fifty meters in diameter (the minimum
necessary to produce Mars gravity at a rate of 
rotation slow enough to avoid problems in all morphs)
and between fifty and two hundred meters long or
a zero-g sphere one hundred to two hundred meters
in diameter. These habitats are always tethered to
a small collection of raw materials, consisting of
chunks of silicate, nickel-iron, and water-containing
carboniferous asteroids with a mass equal to at
least that of the habitat. The majority of private
habitats are inhabited by between half a dozen and
three dozen morphs, most of which may be AIs
or indentured servants. Life in a private habitat is
exceptionally lavish. Almost every surface is made
of formatible smart materials and there are several
large general-purpose cornucopia machines available
for the use of every resident.

By using these nanofabricators and the smart materials
to their fullest, residents can completely change
the interior of the habitat in only a day or 
two—transforming a sterile and crystalline array of shining metal
and glass buildings into a thriving forest, inhabited by
a variety of wild animals. The mesh is filled with vids
and XPs about the lives of the most famous residents
of the solar system. Almost everyone has seen the interior
of one of these vast space mansions many times,
though only a tiny percentage of the inhabitants of
the solar system will ever have a chance to actually
visit such a location. Many gatecrashers, scavengers
who travel to Earth, and others who engage in
similarly daring endeavors hope to be able to obtain
information or objects sufficiently valuable to allow
them to retire to their own private habitat.
