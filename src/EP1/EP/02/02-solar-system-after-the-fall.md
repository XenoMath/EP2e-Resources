# THE SOLAR SYSTEM AFTER THE FALL

Before the Fall, the solar system had a population of
approximately eight billion, with all but five million
of these people living on Earth. The Fall wiped out
almost ninety-five percent of transhumanity, and
today the population of the solar system is slightly less
than half a billion, with almost all of these transhumans
living off the Earth. The lifestyles of these people
were almost unimaginable thirty years earlierâ€”the
vast majority are immortals living in sealed habitats
on hostile alien planets or in sealed space colonies, the
largest of which hold more than a million inhabitants
and are many kilometers long.

In this vastly changed setting with its vastly
changed inhabitants, the core concerns of transhumanity
remain much the same. People seek both
material abundance and social status, and they wrap
themselves in various public and private ceremonies.
Like generations of humans before them, transhumans
separate themselves into different cultures
and subcultures, all of which enjoy a wide variety of
physical and virtual entertainments. Politics and economics
remain vitally important and, as always, those
who are wealthy, powerful, and famous have a large
degree of control over the lives of those who are poor,
relatively powerless, and unknown.
