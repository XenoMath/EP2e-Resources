# CULTURE AND SOCIETY

The Fall and its aftermath continues to be a major
influence on transhuman culture and society. Prior
to the start of the evacuation, more than ninety-nine
percent of the people who survived the Fall had never
been off Earth. For them, space was a distant realm
where other, more daring and adventurous people
lived, a place Earth dwellers only saw on videos.
Earth was their home. Then, in the course of a few
short years, hundreds of millions of people were
forced to leave their home planet behind. The fortunate
few first evacuees left with no more than a dozen
kilograms of possessions, while the vast majority
were infomorph refugees who escaped with nothing,
not even their bodies.

Today, transhumanity is divided into three groups.
The first group contains the true veterans of space
life, the less-than-one-percent of humanity that was
already living in space before the Fall. The second
group is the ten percent of the population that was
either born after the Fall or is too young to remember
living on Earth. The remaining eighty-nine percent of
the current population of the solar system lived generally
happy and prosperous lives on Earth before the
Fall forced them to flee to safety. These refugees form
a powerful social force, but as time goes on memories
of Earth grow dim and people adapt to their new
homes and lives.

## NOSTALGIA JEWELRY

As both a reminder and a visible marker of their
lost homeland, a significant number of refugees
from Earth wear jewelry containing a coin or,
more rarely, an old stamp from transhumanity’s 
former home. Popularly known as nostalgia
jewelry, most of these items are made into pendants
or lapel pins, but a few are rings. Before
the Fall, coins and stamps were largely curiosities
primarily of interest to collectors, having fallen
out of use forty years BF. Already scarce, few
were saved during the Fall as carrying such
useless mass off Earth during the evacuation was
discouraged or forbidden. A few extensive 
collections already existed off-world, however. Even
so, less than a million authentic samples survived,
meaning the vast majority of people wearing
such items make do with exact copies made in
cornucopia machines. Actual coins or stamps are
very expensive, meaning that some daring scavengers
are willing to risk the interdiction of Earth
for the express purpose of salvaging relics.

## THE LONGING FOR EARTH

Most of transhumanity, especially those who were forced
to evacuate from the dying Earth, still mourn their
former home. Their longing for and nostalgia of Earth
has profoundly affected transhuman culture. Artifacts
from Earth, including ones as trivial as coins or bits of
dried vegetation, are considered treasured mementos
that have great economic and emotional value.

The interdiction of Earth makes acquiring such
artifacts quite difficult and dangerous. As a result,
the trade in Earth relics is a lucrative portion of the
black market, enough so that fearless scavengers are
willing to risk being shot down by a patrolling killsat
just to get to Earth, where they also face death from
numerous lingering dangers. The mesh is peppered
with stories of daring explorers who traveled to Earth
to retrieve all manner of priceless artifacts, as well as
an equal number of stories about explorers who died
or simply vanished on such expeditions. More than
one team of gatecrashers has funded their expedition
through a preliminary relic-hunting expedition
to Earth, which serves to test their mettle while they
work to raise funds.

Nostalgia for Earth also affects the way transhu-
manity has redesigned itself. In the decade prior to
the Fall, transhumanity had begun to freely alter
itself. Radical body modification and the success of
commercial resleeving resulted in a growing number
of obviously non-human morphs. The vast majority
of current morphs, however, are relatively human in
appearance (if not always in internal structure). Even
for people too young to remember the Fall, asserting
individual humanity is an important part of post-Fall
culture. Some people keep a resemblance to the traditional
human form as a remembrance of Earth, while
others do it to celebrate humanity’s victory over the
monstrous and inhuman TITANs that attempted to
destroy them. With the exception of a few eccentric
groups like the ultimates, the majority of humanity
values looking human and preserving human traditions
and institutions. Even the ultimates’ current
version of their remade morph is considerably more
human looking than the versions their predecessors
designed before the Fall. Even most synthmorphs,
which have no restrictions to size or form, are made
to look humanoid. There are a few radically inhuman
morphs like the novacrab, the arachnoid, and the
flexbot but they are almost exclusively used for highly
specialized purposes. Until recently, anyone who used
one as their primary morph was considered deeply
eccentric (or worse), but attitudes have softened,
and these morphs are becoming more acceptable for
regular use.

This mixture of reverence and nostalgia for Earth
sometimes has a darker side. Individuals who choose
to have morphs that look visibly non-human experience
a mild degree of prejudice in many habitats,
and militant bioconservatives denounce those who
look sufficiently non-human as being covert allies
of the TITANs. Uplifted animals also face significan
discrimination from many humans. These prejudices
are relatively common in the inner system and can
be quite extreme among bioconservatives. As a result,
uplifts and individuals who prefer inhuman-looking
morphs often live in separatist communities in the
outer system. In much of the inner system, uplifts and
individuals using a visibly non-human morph as their
primary or only morph are viewed with suspicion and
occasionally treated as second-class citizens. While
most habitats have laws mandating morphological
freedom and many also have laws making prejudice
based on morphological choice illegal, these attitudes
remain quite resilient.

Ok, you asked, so I’ll tell you. There are some elements within Firewall
that don’t buy into the TITANs-ran-amok-and-considered-us-a-threat
idea, or even that the TITANs are solely responsible for the Fall. These
people think that the TITANs found or encountered something when
they started their takeoff toward the singularity—something that
changed them. They point to the wide range of multi-vector viruses
that ran loose during the Fall and how even many of the TITANs
seem to have succumbed to these infections. They also reference a
disturbing number of accounts of events during the Fall that are 
inexplicable … things like people being transformed into strange, alien
creatures … or phenomena that seem to defy certain physical laws,
as if something was at times ignoring what we know of physics and
just doing whatever it felt like. Some of these voices within Firewall
even think that the TITANs may not have been responsible for the
Pandora gates. They have a name for this mystery infection. They call
it the “exsurgent virus.”

</blockquote>

## FEAR AND PARANOIA

The Fall left behind a persistent legacy of fear. This
has faded over the past decade, but a great many
humans still unconsciously expect the other shoe
to drop and the TITANs to return at any moment.
Others worry that their agents are already among
them, preparing for the complete destruction of
transhumanity. The arrival of the Factors caused
widespread panic, and even today a substantial
minority of people assumes they are cat’s-paws for
the TITANs—or possibly their creations.

There are a few (often insane or deeply eccentric)
people who worship the TITANs or otherwise support
their agenda (including self-described “singularity
seekers” who hope to find and be uploaded by the
TITANs to join their ascension to super-intelligence),
but all of them must keep their beliefs carefully hidden.
Even now, expressing any support for the TITANs or
advocating the creation of self-improving seed AIs is
illegal in most habitats. Anyone who does so runs the
risk of becoming the target of mob violence that the
authorities are unlikely to investigate too closely. Merely
being suspected of being a supporter of the TITANs,
or worse, someone who has been secretly infected by
them and is now their agent, is enough to get someone
shunned or even killed. While such incidents are now
far rarer than they were in the first few years after the
Fall, people who act too odd and who lack someone
with a sufficiently high rep to defend them or explain
their actions are occasionally killed, typically by being
thrown out an airlock. Those responsible for these
“spacings” are dealt with quite harshly in most habitats,
since in almost all cases later investigation reveals that
the victim had no connection to the TITANs.

There are also periodic rumors in many habitats,
especially small and isolated stations, that one or
more other habitats have been taken over by the
TITANs, leading to a variety of inter-colony problems.
Such rumors are usually resolved quickly, but the
most persistent can seriously harm relations between
habitats. Claims that other stations are infested
with or even controlled by agents of the TITANs
are frequenly employed by extreme bioconserva-
tives hoping to demonize radical habitats populated
entirely by infomorphs or synthmorphs. As more
people manage to put the fear and horror of the
Fall behind them, such claims are less likely to be
believed. Unfortunately, people are still occasionally
infected by TITAN-created relics and actually become
their unwilling agents. Since such incidents are rare,
however, they have become easy to dismiss.

## REAL AND SOCIAL DISTANCE

Communications suffer a significant time lag
between asking a question and receiving an answer
due to the vast distances between most habitats—
with the exception of those using the rare and expensive 
[QE communicators](../10/05-communications.md#quantum-entangled-communication).
The time lag ranges from a few seconds to several hours, and it
makes real-time communications between distant
habitats difficult or impossible. Communication
problems only serve to further isolate habitats from
one another. As a result, people socialize primarily
with members of their own habitat or cluster (if
their station is part of one of the various groupings
of between two and twenty habitats that abound
throughout the solar system).

Within a habitat or cluster, communication between
residents is effectively instantaneous thanks to the
omnipresent wireless grid known as 
[the mesh](../08/00-mesh.md).
Anyone wearing a 
[mid-range ecto](../10/08-everyday-technology.md)
or using
[basic mesh inserts](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#basic-mesh-inserts)
can communicate with
others in ways that go far beyond mere voice contact.
Both devices allow AR communications that are in
most ways barely distinguishable from in-person
communication, so people can effectively spend
in-person time with anyone in their habitat at any
moment when both of them are free and interested in
communicating. Unless someone deliberately wishes
to turn off communication because they are sleeping
or otherwise busy, people can always get in touch
with one another. Many close friends and romantic
partners regularly communicate anytime they have
a spare moment, sharing comments and jokes. This
communication is far more awkward and distant if
there is a time lag of several minutes between every
comment, so inter-habitat communication is never as
informal or close.

Though travel via egocasting (transmitting an ego
to another habitat, where it is resleeved) is as easy,
if not as cheap, as communication, a trip to another
station is considered to be a significant journey with
a range of costs. Traveling individuals will no longer
be able to engage in real-time communication or
shared real-time entertainments with people back
on the habitat they left, so they will have to find a
new social environment. In addition to the trouble
and expense of acquiring a new morph in the new
habitat, the social distance between individuals and
the social network they leave behind is part of the
cost of travel.

Before the Fall, refugees from Earth were accustomed
to easily communicating with anyone else
on Earth. Wealthier individuals could journey just
about anywhere on the planet in a few hours while
still being able to communicate with everyone
back in their home city with no noticeable change.
The exodus of transhumanity from Earth, though,
means that an individual’s social world is only as
large as their habitat. Even a relatively brief communication
lag, such as the two to thirty seconds
that is the average time lag between any two of the
Jovian or Saturnian moons, greatly hinders the flo
of back-and-forth communication. When time-lags
are involved, most exchanges consist of messages
rather than any attempt at continuous conversation.
In situations where a more in-depth discussion is
necessary and time is limited, someone can send
a fork of 
themselves—[a digital copy](../09/03-forking-merging.md)—to
hold the discussion remotely on their behalf and
then return for re-integration. Since there is already
a large time lag between sending a message and
obtaining any possible response, most people do
not hurry to answer messages from distant habitats
except in the most urgent circumstances, further
isolating people residing in distant portions of the
solar system.

<blockquote>

## SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: SINGULARITY SEEKERS

Singularity seekers are those with
an unhealthy fascination in so-called
singularity events, such as the hard
takeoff of the TITANs to super-intelligence.
Some are part of a radical
sect of “exhumans” who believe
that transhumans are destined to
become godlike superbeings and are
determined to get there first. Others
act on a defensive impulse, believing
that the only way transhumanity can
survive another threat from beings
like the TITANs is by becoming as
hyper-intelligent as their enemies
are. Still other singularity seekers are
researchers or spiritual seekers who
are frustrated with the limitations of
their own minds and seek to become
something greater. Some of these
people become gatecrashers, searching
for advanced alien artifacts to help
them in their quest. Others experiment
with employing conventional technologies
in new and exotic ways, such as
creating mentally linked networks of
forks or incorporating extra-fast and
powerful computers into synthmorphs
and pods.

A few of the most daring seek
artifacts left behind by the TITANs,
hoping to incorporate techniques
and technologies created by these
inhuman beings into their minds. This
last group is the most notorious, in
large part because of the spectacular
nature of some of their failures. On
occasion, these artifact hunters have
awakened devices that have lain dormant
for a decade and caused local outbreaks
of TITAN technologies. These incidents
have caused many people to regard
singularity seekers as everything from
potentially dangerous eccentrics to
unknowing pawns of the TITANs.

## THE RISE OF CULTURAL REGIONS

The only exception to the social distance between different
habitats occurs when colonies are located on
or in relatively close orbit around the same planet or
moon. The inhabitants of Mars can all communicate
with one another instantaneously, as can everyone on
Luna or in Lunar orbit. However, the rivalry between
the various Martian city-states—and between the
primary hypercorp domes and the rural Martian
poor—imposes its own social distance. Individuals
from different city-states do socialize, but among the
elite social cliques, spending too much time 
communicating with members of another city-state is viewed
as somewhat odd and potentially even disloyal. As
a result, Martians tend to be relatively isolated even
from their close neighbors. Nevertheless, the short
distances between the Martian city-states and the
orbiting habitats mean that there remains a general
Martian culture that is different from the cultures of
the rest of the solar system.

Distance barriers have produced similar levels of
cultural differentiation in other portions of the solar
system. The colonies in the vicinity of both Jupiter
and Saturn each form a separate cultural unit, as do
the colonies in Earth orbit and on and around Luna.
The same is true for the Jovian Trojan and Greek
asteroids. In each of these regions, people communicate
and travel more between habitats and settlements
than they do with outside regions.

Social scientists refer to the different sections of the
solar system as separate cultural regions. The different
regions of the belt also each form a similar cultural
region, but because asteroids in different orbits 
eventually drift quite far apart, the cohesion and unity of
these cultural units is somewhat weaker. Habitats on
the edge of the solar system (around Uranus, Neptune,
and Pluto) form very small cultural regions, but the
few habitats in the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud have
no cultural region since the distance between them is
so extreme.

Though communications between habitats within
the same cultural region is somewhat awkward due
to intra-regional cultural differences and small 
time-lags, it is usually fast and easy enough for people on
different habitats to keep in regular contact with one
another. In addition, most habitats within the same
cultural region are sufficiently close that egocasting
between them is affordable by most people. In contrast,
egocasting between cultural regions is relatively
expensive. Many social scientists predict that within
one or two decades, different cultural regions will
be at least as different from one another as distant
nations of Earth were from one another during the
first half of the 20th century—perhaps even more so
due to the physical alterations that cultures introduce
as they continue to evolve.

## CULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION

While nostalgia for old nations remains a powerful
social motivation, the break from Earth led many
inhabitants of the solar system to experiment with
new forms of culture and society. Since the Fall
destroyed physical links with the past and the defeat
of the last Earth governments ended ideological ties
with the old political and social forces, many 
transhumans saw themselves as living in a new, free era
where the past was dead. Even people who always
wear nostalgia jewelry and spend several hours a day
in simulspaces set on old Earth are very interested in
the possibility of social and political experimentation.

Many of the most radical social experimenters
were drawn to the numerous small outer system
habitats created in the decade after the Fall, but
people interested in social and cultural experimentation
can be found throughout the solar system. In
addition to playing with various interior structure
and design ideas, the inhabitants of many stations
experiment with all manner of unique social and
political rules. A few habitats do so quite deliberately,
either because the members are interested in social
innovation or because researchers associated with
a hypercorp or university have offered them goods
or services in return for testing one of their latest
theories. Such experiments have included establishing
stations where all of the residents are sleeved
in hermaphroditic morphs in order to measure the
impact on customs and language when gender is
abolished or spurring the residents of a particular
station to freely switch their morphs based on the
responsibilities and duties they have on a given day.
Such staged experiments are, however, relatively
rare—the vast majority of unique customs and social
structures that have come about since the Fall naturally
evolved from groups of like-minded individuals
living together in the same habitat and working,
consciously or not, to make life better fit with their
aesthetics or ideology.

## GENDER, SEXUALITY, AND RELATIONSHIPS

To many transhumans, gender has become an outdated
social construct with no basis in biology. After
all, it’s hard to give credence to gender roles when
an ego can easily modify their sex, switch skins, or
experience the lives of others via XP. Though most
transhumans still adhere to the gender associated
with their original biological sex, many others
switch gender identities as soon as they reach adulthood
or avidly pursue repeated transgender switching.
Still others examine and adopt untraditional
sex-gender identities such as neuter (believing a lack
of sex allows greater focus in their pursuits) or dual
gender (the best of both worlds). In bioconservative
habitats and cultures, however, traditional gender
roles persevere.

Sexuality has also expanded into new frontiers and
taboos. With basic biomods providing contraception
and protections from STDs, casual sex is the norm.
Many people pursue careers as well-paid companions
and escorts. In fact, sexual experimentation is
standard thanks to several new technologies. Virtual
reality allows sexual encounters without physically
touching a partner, not to mention bringing all
manner of fantasies to life. For those that prefer the
touch of real skin, AI-driven pleasure pods can fulfil
any and all needs and are a legal form of prostitution
in many habitats. Sex-switching also lends itself to
new experiences, whether via biomods or a new sleeve.
Those who are particularly adventurous pursue sex
with robots, interspecies sex with uplifts, and stranger
things. Even AGIs, having been socialized as humans,
exhibit sexuality and desire.

The extension of lifespans and the decline of religion
have drastically impacted social institutions like
marriage. Given the possible changes to both cognition
and biology over a transhuman’s lifetime, lifelong
relationships are no longer considered realistic. The
idea of long-term relationships as a social contract
has grown exponentially. While this has resulted in a
number of marriages that are political or conducted
like a business transaction, most people continue
to view marriage as a bond of love and trust—an
emotional attachment that transcends bodies, as either
partner may change morphs at any time.

## THE DIVERSITY OF HABITATS

The ability of a few thousand like-minded people of
moderate means to acquire a small habitat where they
can create their own society resembles the ability of
inhabitants of the United States in the 19th century
to set out for the West and found their own ideologically
based communities. The primary difference is
that creating such communities is faster and easier in
the modern era. The mesh is filled with all manner of
virtual communities where members hope to eventually
gather the means to create their own habitats. In
most cases, these are merely idle dreams; most participants
are not willing to sacrifice the time and rep or
money needed. Occasionally the members try, only to
find out that some of the people promoting this effort
are con artists. Others succeed in building their own
habitat only to find their new society is not as idyllic
as hoped. An amazing amount thrive. A decade of this
sort of cultural experimentation by many hundreds
of habitats has produced a number of unique and
strange societies.

As an example, there are habitats where the
inhabitants wear garments and AR images that cover
their bodies—and, in the most extreme cases, their
faces—and residents only reveal their morph’s true
appearance to their closest friends and immediate
family. There are also stations where all members use
cosmetic modification to adopt the same ideal look,
as well as ones where all residents use morphs that
are clones of one another. Some of the most eccentric
habitats are populated by extreme bioconservatives
overcome with nostalgia for the past, leading them
to model both their society and all visible technology
after some earlier period in history, typically some
time between zero and 50 years BF.

There are even a few habitats that totally disregard
commonly held feelings about forks and
merging. Such community members regularly split
off multiple forks when they awaken and plan their
day and then merge the various forks when they go
to sleep that night. Some forks remain infomorphs
for the day, while others use one of the various
morphs the individual owns or rents, which means
that each resident typically lives between two and
six separate lives every day. A few societies, like
the home of the infamous Pax Familiae, go even
further—all residents are forks of the same individual.
In some of these solipsistic habitats, the
forks are all expected to use cloned morphs, while
in others each fork is considered a separate person
who should go and forge their own unique life.
Some of the less extreme manifestations of this type
of habitat include places inhabited by families that
are partially or entirely composed of forks of one of
the members (the various forks tend to be treated
as siblings).
