Transhumanity has extended out from its lost homeworld
and colonized not only the solar system but
various exoplanets as well, thanks to the discovery
of the Pandora gates. This section provides an overview
and incomplete sampling of transhumanity’s
settlements.

<blockquote>

## A QUICK PRIMER ON TRANSHUMAN HABITATS

Habitats are covered in detail 
[here](../09/07-life-space.md).
A quick overview is provided here:

- **Aerostats** are massive cities floating in the upper cloud
    layers of Venus.
- **Beehives** are tunnel warrens inside asteroids and moons.
- **Bernal Spheres** are artificial bubble worlds spun for gravity.
- **Clusters** are microgravity habitats consisting of interconnected modules.
- **Cole bubble** habitats are hollowed-out asteroids,
    terraformed on the inside, and also spun for gravity.
- **Dome habitats** are massive domes built on the surface of 
    moons, asteroids, or Mars.
- **Hamilton cylinders** are self-building advanced nano-
    tech habitats designs.
- **O’Neill cylinder** habitats are like huge soda cans over a
    kilometer wide and several kilometers long. The interior is
    terraformed and the entire cylinder is spun for gravity.
- **Reagan cylinders** are an inefficient type of O’Neill
    cylinder, built by hollowing a cylinder within a spinning
    asteroid, and used in the Jovian Republic.
- **Tin can** habitats are small, cramped, cheap, modular
    boxes, typically used in early space colonization.
- **Torus habitats** are big donuts or wheels, spun so that the
    outer rim has gravity. The interior spokes are zero g.

## SOL (THE SUN)

The solar system was formed billions of years ago
through the accretion of material remaining from the
formation of its star, Sol, the sun. Locked ever since in
its orbit, the history and present disposition of virtually
every object within two light years is shaped by
its relationship to this body. The sun is a bright G2
main sequence star, theoretically on the hot end of the
continuum of stars able to give rise to life. For most
of its history, transhumanity fueled its rises and falls
with the sun’s energy, first as stored in materials like
hydrocarbons, later directly with solar converters.

Today the sun remains a crucial source of energy,
but its outer reaches have also become home to some.
The adaptations required to dwell here make these
*Solarians* one of transhumanity’s most unusual offshoots.

### SURYAS AND SALAMANDERS (CORONAL MORPHS)

Perhaps an example of transhumanity’s most extreme
neogenetic creations are the morphs adapted to live
in the sun’s corona. Suryas, named after a hindu sun
deity, are large, whale-like, and uniquely adapted to
dwell in the brilliant, superheated plasma cloud of the
sun’s outermost layer. Each surya is like a miniature
version of a circumsolar habitat. Their metabolisms
generate powerful magnetic fields that shield them
from the sun’s heat and radiation, while acting as
magnetic sails and scoops by which they sail on the
currents of the solar wind and extract elements carried
on it. Suryas are protected by layers of liquid water
“blubber” that capture harmful ions, which internal
medichines extract and eject, while maintaining useful
elements such as oxygen and hydrogen, from which
more water can be synthesized. They communicate
using patterns of dark and light coloration on their
exterior skins and are extremely sensitive to the helio-seismic
soundwaves that are the sun’s pulse, using
these vibrations to predict and avoid heavy weather
in the coronal atmosphere.

A second type of coronal morph is the salamander,
a tiny humanoid morph with gas jets on the back and
chest for maneuvering in vacuum. Salamanders have
very similar metabolisms to suryas, but are unable to
survive unprotected in the corona. They subsist on the
chemicals and energy extracted from the corona by
Ukko Jylinä, the only habitat where they are found.

Both suryas and salamanders communicate either
via transmissions from their implants or by
“sunspotting”—shifting dark and light patterns on their skins
to form language.

### HABITATS

Habitats in Sol’s corona face challenges more extreme
than those anywhere else in the system. Transhumanity’s
only means of shielding a habitat from the heat and
radiation emitted by a G2 star is to generate strong
electromagnetic fields Even then, the dangers posed by
solar flares and coronal mass ejections—massive explosions
that jettison coronal material tens of thousands
of kilometers out into circumsolar space—mean that
the sun’s polar regions are the only safe space in which
to position habitats. As such, circumsolar habs require
extraordinary expense to build and maintain, and two
of the three major circumsolar stations are heavily
backed by distant organizations.

The outer layers of circumsolar habitats are covered
with thousands of electromagnetic dynamos drawing
power from the sun itself. These dynamos generate
the powerful fields necessary for shielding. Within
are intermediate layers filled with liquid water that
capture ionized particles, teeming with nanobots that
collect the ions and vent them into space. The water
must be regularly replaced from captured iceteroids
that are imported using heavy electromagnetic shielding
of their own. Within the water shield is a cluster
habitat, an array of modules on a framework following
a roughly spherical plan.

Coronal habitats are easily detectable at a great distance
because of the bow shock preceding them and
the plasma tail left behind in the solar wind.

### ATEN
Operated by a consortium including hypercorp
interests and the University of New Shanghai, Aten
supports a population of about 12,000 transhumans.
Rumors abound that military research is a major
component of this habitat’s mission. Aten is heavily
policed and difficult to visit. The most publicized
discoveries from this habitat involve propulsion systems
and new solar energy collection technologies.

### HOOVERMAN-GEISCHECKER

The argonauts and Titan Autonomous University are
the major supporters of this habitat, which supports a
population of about 4,000. In contrast to Aten, access
to this habitat is relatively open. Major avenues of
research include pure science and research into
corona-adapted morphs.

### UKKO JYLINÄ

Ukko Jylinä is the name used by outsiders for the
suryas’ safe harbor. In the surya tongue, the name for
the place is a common sequence of helioseismic vibrations.
When transposed fifteen octaves upward into
the usual range of transhuman hearing, this sound is
a chaotic rumble to most ears, but the suryas consider
it one of the most beautiful sounds the sun makes.

Ukko Jylinä is more of a camp than a hab, an area
of refuge for suryas during severe solar weather. It
also serves as a place for suryas to socialize and mate,
replenish water from imported iceteroids, and egocast
or resleeve. The population therefore fluctuates a
great deal, usually hovering around 300, but swelling
to 3,000 (nearly the entire surya population) during
heavy weather. Ukko Jylinä also has a few modules in
which non-surya morphs can survive.

Very little of Ukko Jylinä consists of enclosed hab
modules. Instead there are many utility modules with
their access ports open to space. Bereft of the solar
wind, suryas within the camp generally wear gas-expelling
maneuvering harnesses or resleeve in salamanders
if they need to do work requiring fine manipulation


## VULCANOIDS

The Vulcanoids are a population of asteroids that lie
between Mercury and the sun. Based on the predictions
of early 21 st-century science, the number of
Vulcanoids is unexpectedly small.


### V/2011-CALDWELL

Discovered in the early 21st century and subject to
a flyby by a Japanese solar research mission in the
2020s, V/2011-Caldwell was nothing but a line on
astronomers’ catalogs, notable only for the virtual lack
of cratering on the one side that was photographed.
Then, a few years after the dust settled from the Fall,
a small team of prospectors from Venus discovered
a Pandora gate. Now controlled by TerraGenesis,
Caldwell was used primarily for exoplanet research for
several years, though the hypercorp is now engaged
in several alien world terraforming and geoengineering
projects. TerraGenesis regularly sells gate access
to other hypercorps and organizations. Caldwell is a
remarkably smooth, spindle-shaped asteroid about
four kilometers long and half a kilometer in diameter
at its widest point. Called the Vulcanoid Gate, it is
situated at the bottom of a deep crag near one of the
asteroid’s narrow poles.


## MERCURY

The closest planet to the sun has a mass comparable
to Luna but is a great deal denser due to its iron-nickel
core. Mercury rotates slowly and has no atmosphere,
so that its day side is hot enough to melt most metals,
while its night side is bitterly cold. Because it lacks
many of the elements needed for transhuman colonies
to be self-sufficient Mercury is sparsely inhabited,
save for a handful of solar power relays, a few underground
mining stations, and a single large surface
mining concern, Cannon.

### RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS

Most of Mercury’s economy is based on mining.
Iron, nickel, and other metals make up 70% of the
planet’s mass, making it the richest source of ferrous
metals outside of the asteroids. Mercury also does a
brisk business in relaying solar power and serves as a
jumping-off point for solar research concerns unwilling
or unable to support stations in the solar corona.
Mercury has limited helium-3 deposits, although these
are predominantly mined for local use. It is an open
secret that several powers have antimatter production
stations here. Officially, these stations are massive
solar power relays, but the immense toroid particle
accelerators and large spherical magnetic containment
units required for antimatter production and storage
are nearly impossible to disguise.


### CALORIS 18

The only known site of TITAN activity on Mercury
during the Fall, Caloris 18 was a sparsely crewed
solar power relay station belonging to Lukos, a
now-defunct Russian corporation. Vanya Ilyanovich,
the AGI administering the facility, rounded up all of
the station’s transhuman inhabitants and fused their
morphs into a gigantic, centipede-like abomination
before destroying itself in a failed attempt to merge
consciousnesses with all of the minds in its creation.
Since then, Caloris 18 has been under strict quarantine.

### CANNON

Mercury’s largest surface settlement is a city-scaled
solar satellite-powered mobile mass driver that crawls
along the cool side of the planet, flinging apartment
building-sized ingots of extracted metal into space.
The habitat is owned almost entirely by the hypercorp
Jaehon Offworld, which built Cannon with backing
from Lunar banks looking to diversify in anticipation
of a post-He3 Lunar economy. Most of the 10,000
inhabitants are Jaehon employees, and security is tight.
Cannon makes a long loop of the heavily mined Caloris
basin during the long Mercurian night before following
a route that takes it around the planet’s northern 
hemisphere, avoiding the blasting rays of the sun. Along the
way, it stops at a series of mining operations, collecting
the gigantic ingots for launch into orbit.

## VENUS

Venus is Earth’s closest neighbor and the planet most
like it in terms of size and geology. It is a rugged world
of volcanic mountains, canyons, high plateaus, and
sweeping volcanic planes crisscrossed by river-like
magma channels. Much of the surface is basaltic rock.
The climate of Venus is one of the most inhospitable
in the solar system. Perhaps only the hideous radiation
of the inner Jovian moons presents a more difficul
challenge to transhuman colonization. The Venusian
atmosphere is a superheated maelstrom of carbon
dioxide and sulfuric acid, with an atmospheric pressure
at its surface equivalent to that five kilometers
below the surface of Earth’s oceans. Venus also lacks
more than trace amounts of hydrogen, meaning that
water must be imported in the form of iceteroids from
the outer system.

Nonetheless, transhumanity has come to Venus and,
with it, debate over how to make use of the planet.
Venus has no permanently inhabited surface settlements
other than a few mining camps and equipment
and supply caches used by planetside researchers.
Despite difficulties transhumanity has found survival
strategies that work here. The most surprising of these
are the aerostats, lighter-than-carbon dioxide habitats
that float in the thick Venusian atmosphere. Aside
from a few independents or ones loyal to the Planetary
Consortium, these aerostats are the base of the new
Morningstar Constellation power bloc. Notable for
their research labs, nanofab design houses, software
studios, and luxury resorts, the Constellation’s
aerostats are increasingly at odds with Planetary
Consortium and Lunar-Lagrange Alliance interests.

On some aerostats, areas populated only by indentured
synthmorphs are open to the Venusian atmosphere.
Some 5,000,000 transhumans live in aerostat
habitats and another 10,000 on the surface. Roughly
350,000 transhumans live in habitats orbiting Venus

Though the Planetary Consortium is considering
the launch of a Venusian terraforming project,
this plan is actively opposed by the Morningstar
Constellation. The Constellation’s aerostats see the
terraforming proposals—which include massive cometary
bombardment or building a planet-sized sun
shade to cool the atmosphere—as not only unworkable
but disruptive to their lives and profits

Venus is a fascinating place for climatologists,
geologists, and other planetary scientists. The discovery
of Venusian protobacteria created a new branch
of life sciences overnight, though so far the practical
applications for organisms with such radically different
metabolisms from terrestrial life have been limited.

### GERLACH

Gerlach is an O’Neill cylinder supporting about
120,000 transhumans. Generally recognized as the
research powerhouse of Venus, Gerlach is also one of
the strangest places in the inner system. The inhabitants
have strong ties to the argonauts, sympathies for
the outer-system autonomists, and are strong proponents
of morphological freedom, cognitive experimentation,
and open innovation. Gerlach’s main activities
are planetside research and exploration, hostile
environment morph design, and aerostat construction.

### OCTAVIA

Octavia is the most successful aerostat habitat to
date and the political center of the Morningstar
Constellation. It maintains an altitude of roughly 55
kilometers above the northern highlands of Ishtar
Terra. Octavia resembles an immense, mushroom-shaped
skyscraper, 450 meters tall, ringed at its center
by four radial outrigger spars, each ending in a
stabilizing gas envelope filled with helium. The cap of the
mushroom is a hard, translucent dome that provides
an open, park like space while also serving as the main
gas envelope (oxygen, which is much lighter than the
CO2 making up most of Venus’s atmosphere, is the
main source of buoyancy). The habitat is fluted from
top to bottom, going from a diameter of almost 300
meters at the base of the dome, to 15 meters wide at
the very bottom. A huge counterweight tethered to the
bottom of the structure prevents the habitat from
capsizing during storms. Atmospheric craft and shuttles
from orbit may land at flight decks near the base of
the outriggers. 500,000 people live aboard Octavia.

### APHRODITE PRIME

One of 20 smaller aerostats, Aphrodite Prime hovers
54 kilometers above Aphrodite Terra. It is a center for
Venusian tourism; fully a quarter of this aerostat is a
resort for wealthy offworld visitors. Aphrodite Prime
is also the primary research station for the design and
creation of life forms adapted to live in the Venusian
clouds. This aerostat has a population of 300,000 and
features closed-environment test aviaries populated
with clouds of air plankton and schools of recently
designed flying squid and balloon fish

### VENUSIAN RUMORS

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

We need you to investigate some odd rumors
circulating about activity on the Venusian
surface. According to reports, an Omnicor
research team went missing about a week
ago. Unlike many Venus surface teams, these
weren’t teleoperated bots but actual
synthmorph-sleeved researchers operating away
from the safety of an aerostat’s tether—which
is suspicious behavior itself. Search parties
have turned up no sign of the missing morphs,
but scuttlebutt says they ran into signs of
recent TITAN activity that have them freaked
out. I haven’t found any evidence to back this
up, yet—it could just be some misinformation
to keep people from digging around that part
of the surface. I’ve heard that some security
corps have some quantum data caches buried
away down there. Looking into this may
require getting a hold of some heat- and
pressure-resistant synthetic morphs.

</blockquote>

## EARTH

Ecologically devastated and infested by the weird
spawn of the TITANs, transhumanity’s homeworld
doesn’t get many visitors. Earth’s once-populous
urban regions are massive sprawls ruined by war and
heavy weather, infested with dangerous artificial life
and the occasional survivalist gang. Elsewhere,
irradiated blast zones and desolate wasteland prevail. Due
to harsh climatic conditions, the wilderness has been
slow to reassert itself. Vast swaths of dead forest or
burned grassland are common sights.

Even from orbit, Earth shows deep scars. Breaks
in the sooty cloud cover created by orbital bombardment
during the Fall reveal continents ravaged by
coastal flooding desertification and radical
temperature shifts. The only known detonation of an
antimatter bomb within a planetary atmosphere,
centered on what was the Chicago-waukee Metroplex
in North America, left a crater over 200 kilometers
wide wherein most matter was instantly vaporized.
Craters left by mass driver bombardment dot the
surface as well. Mass die-offs of lynchpin species
like honey bees and krill destroyed entire ecosystems,
leaving vast swathes of barren land and sea
inhabited by only the most adaptable species. Most
of Europe is sub-artic; much of Africa and North
America, desert. Ironically, transhumanity’s deployment
of nuclear weapons against TITAN surface
installations arrested the effects of global warming
by creating a nuclear winter. Nuclear attacks against
Earth have ceased, but the Lunar mass drivers still
occasionally hurl captured asteroids at suspected
surface works created by remaining TITAN war
machines. In any case, the damage from humanity’s
warming of the globe was already done. The patterns
of life on Earth, and the very face of the planet, have
been irrevocably rewritten.

Earth once had multiple space elevators in operation,
but with exception of the Kilimanjaro beanstalk,
the others were destroyed during the Fall, wrapping
around the planet as they crashed to Earth, leaving
swathes of destruction.

### POPULATION

Earth’s population is a matter of speculation. The
reclaimers and Lunar authorities, both of whom
spend a great deal of effort monitoring Earth, agree
that surface energy emissions suggest a population of
about one million once-humans living as servitors to
the TITANs, although these numbers assume patterns
of energy usage similar to those of pre-Fall humanity.

Though the Planetary Consortium claims that no
survivors remain on Earth, reclaimer estimates guess
that between 20,000 and 100,000 free transhumans
remain. These numbers are hard to formulate, given
the limited number of remote areas where transhumans
could remain undetected while obtaining
enough food to subsist. Some areas likely to conceal
sizable remnant populations include the highlands of
Papua-New Guinea, the Ozark Mountains of North
America, and the jungle uplands of Vietnam and Laos,
though it is also possible that certain underground
and undersea settlements survive. Attempts to make
contact with survivors universally end in disaster.

During the Fall, thousands of people unable to
escape Earth resorted to having themselves backed
up and transmitted off-planet. Many of these—along
with some who had no backups—also put their bodies
in cryogenic storage, hoping to wait out the Fall for
rescue. Some reclaimers have speculated that dozens
of these cryogenic facilities may still be functional.

### HABITATS

Earth had a mature orbital industry sector and a
considerable population in orbit at the time of the Fall,
with over a billion people living full-time in space.
Earth orbit was one of the fiercest battlegrounds of
the Fall, however, and hundreds of habitats and other
installations were destroyed or rendered unusable. As
such, Earth orbit and the Lagrange points are littered
with the detritus of pre-Fall humanity. Derelict
habitats can mean tidy profits for intrepid scavengers, but
many are also infested with TITAN spawn and hostile
nanoswarms, making them incredibly dangerous.

To make matters worse, someone or something has
unleashed a large number of autonomous killsats in
Earth orbit to interdict would-be visitors. Some of
these are repurposed pre-Fall military hardware, while
others are newer constructions. So far, no one claims
responsibility for them. The Planetary Consortium
is suspected, as they support and sometimes enforce
a quarantine of the planet, but the possibility exists
that the killsats may be TITAN relics or the efforts of
another agency.

Despite the chaos of Earth orbit, numerous habitats
remain active here, many of them participants in
either the Planetary Consortium or Lunar-Lagrange
Alliance. Dozens of formerly derelict habitats have
also become home to squatters, some of them with
criminal intent, others just looking to escape the
squalor of life in the overcrowded Lunar-Lagrange
habitats, even if it means taking a risk.

### FRESH KILLS

Essentially an armed-to-the-incisors scum barge,
Fresh Kills is a salvage base near the edge of the
Earth-Luna L5 point. The base is built around a
huge central docking spindle with moorings for
small craft and habitat modules in the center and
massive weapons batteries at either tip. Scavengers
can moor their own craft or, at considerable expense,
egocast in, resleeve at the facility, and hire shuttles
for excursions. The gun batteries are articulated such
that any craft showing signs of trouble can be hastily
jettisoned and destroyed. 2,000 transhumans live on
Fresh Kills, although the population is transient and
fluctuates a good deal.

### PARADISE

Situated in a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 point,
Paradise was an exclusive spa and resort station
for the ultra-rich before the Fall. In the wake of the
Fall, Paradise fell on hard times, swarmed as it was
with refugees and no longer an ideal vacation spot.
Recently, however, Paradise fell back in favor with the
inner system glitterati, who undertook measures to
expel many of the lingering squatters and refurnish
it as an elite social space. Recent rumors suggest the
Consortium’s Hypercorp Council use Paradise for
important face-to-face meetings.

### VO NGUYEN

The reclaimers maintain this station in high geostationary
orbit, monitoring Earth and making plans
for potential geoengineering efforts. Vo Nguyen is a
small O’Neill cylinder hidden in a dangerous cloud of
space junk and protected by swarms of killsats, gun
emplacements, and drones. It is occasionally used as a
jumping-off point for secret surface expeditions.

## LUNA

The first planetary body to host permanent human
habitation, Earth’s sole moon competes with Titan
for the second largest population on a planetary body
in the solar system and remains a lynchpin of culture
and economic activity. Lunar history has been shaped
dramatically by the Fall. Before the need to evacuate
Earth arose, it was expected that Luna would remain
largely an automated mining concern, never attaining
a population of more than a few million. Luna
was never seen as an economically viable location for
colonization, the focus instead falling on Mars and
the outer system.

When the Fall came, every polity that couldn’t
hope for a shot at Mars or elsewhere set its sights
on Luna. The Indians were the only great power
that had invested heavily in Luna. The other three
major settlements, Erato, Nectar, and Shackle, were
multinational and hypercorp concerns with no strong
national affiliations These three cities swelled
overnight into polyglot refugee camps, while the Indian
settlement, New Mumbai, was nuked black by the
corps when it became apparent that a TITAN infection
had taken hold there.

Bereft of nationhood, Lunars developed their own
resourceful, tough-minded culture that emerged as a
counterbalance to the radicalism of the outer system
and the excesses of Mars.

Transportation on Luna is largely by suborbital
rocket, although trans-sonic bullet trains also operate
along shorter routes. The major space port is at
Nectar. There is also a skyhook—a massive orbiting
satellite spaceport that drags a massive tether, which
acts as a space elevator along a track running across
the Lunar surface south of the equator. As a result,
many smaller cities lie along the skyhook track.

### FASHION/DESIGN

Nectar is one of the three fashion/design capitals of
the system (along with Noctis on Mars and Extropia).
The Lunar design houses have two major advantages:
an inventive population and a low planetary gravity
that makes it easier to design for the low gravities
that prevail in much of the system. Some habitats
elsewhere in the system even choose a rotational speed
that simulates Lunar gravity in order to get the
greatest benefit from Lunar designs.

### TILION’S JUPITER BRAIN

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

Our investigation into codename: TILION’s
Lunar research activities has confirmed our
suspicions. The hypercorp is engaged in
experiments to convert confined spherical masses in
the Lunar interior into testbed micro-Jupiter
brains. The silicate-rich Lunar crust makes
the locations they have chosen ideal for the
project. Though we have not verified it, we
believe that TILION not only followed the trail
of TITAN research into this area, but is in fact
in possession of a small cache of TITAN-made
computronium. There is no saying what the
TITANS may have been using this cache for,
what it may store, or what may occur if TILION
completes the project and brings the micro-Jupiter
brain online. Fortunately, time seems to
be on our side, and we have several weeks if
not months before any significant part of the
project is activated. We will continue to
infiltrate and learn more, but we strongly suggest
an erasure squad be moved into position and
placed on standby.

</blockquote>


### HELIUM-3 MINING

Although it’s not the richest place to mine He-3, Luna
has such good infrastructure for extraction and dis-
tribution that it more than makes up for the fact that
Luna is very poor in hydrogen for more conventional
forms of fusion. Unlike the vast reserves of the gas
giants, however, the amount of readily extractable
He-3 in the Lunar regolith is finite Some of the
richer deposits are already tapped out, and concerned
Lunars consider their world’s future after these depos-
its are exhausted a major issue.

### FINANCE

The Lunar banks are the oldest (and thus richest) in
the system, though hypercorps like Solaris are close
on their heels. Interestingly, the rise of the reputation
economy in the outer system has not presented as
much of a problem for these banks as one might have
expected. Lunar banks got hip to the reputation game
long before the Martian financial institutions and
moved in to capitalize on it immediately. By the time
Martian banks knew what was going on, Lunar financial
institutions had struck deals with the Extropians
and dominated all of the points of exchange where
favors could be bartered for cold, hard cash between
inner system corp types and outer system anarchists.
The same genius fueling Lunar design created a
complex barter-to-cash network that almost everyone
uses. While some autonomists find it infuriating that
they have to deal with a monolithic banking system
to get by in the inner system, others are simply happy
to deal with the Lunars instead of the Martians for
this service.

### ERATO (ERATOSTHENES)

Erato (population 5 million) is a major mining center
consisting of a series of heavily shielded surface domes
and a vast underground city. Erato is centered around
the Eratosthenes crater on the southern edge of the
Mare Imbrium (Sea of Showers), in the northern
hemisphere of the Earth-facing side of Luna. Erato has
access to both the rich titanium deposits of the Mare
Imbrium and fields of helium 3-abundant regolith.

Erato is one of the oldest mining settlements on
Luna and one of the first to become commercially
viable. As such, many of the Lunar banks are centered
around this city. The vaulted heights of the
Great Cavern of Erato, originally excavated by a
Sino-European conglomerate, reach a height of 1.5
kilometers at the apex, leaving room for a teeming
city of gardens and towers grown from Lunar silicates
and industrious nanobots, lit from above by sunlight
entering via great mirrored vents.

### NECTAR (NECTARIS)

Nectar (population 9 million) lies about 100 kilometers
due east of Theophilus crater on the Mare
Nectaris (Sea of Nectar) in Luna’s southern hemisphere.
Nectar is a design powerhouse, home to the
great Lunar design houses that set fashion and design
trends for much of the solar system. Due to its location
relatively close to the Lunar equator, Nectar also
hosts Luna’s primary long-haul space port and is on
the pickup path for the Lunar skyhook.

### NEW MUMBAI CONTAINMENT ZONE

The incineration of the New Mumbai colony with
nuclear weapons during the Fall to prevent the spread
of TITAN infection left a scorch mark roughly 100
kilometers in diameter on the face of Luna that is
still visible from high orbit. The colony was a heavily
automated helium-3 mining station, located in the
midst of rich helium-3 fields on the edge of the Mare
Moscoviens. It remains a heavily patrolled quarantine
zone to this day.

### SHACKLE (SHACKLETON-NEW VARANASI)

Shackle (population 6 million), built in and around
the south polar Shackleton crater, is centered on one
of two major water extraction operations on Luna.
New Varanasi, the city of temples, is the most impressive
section of the city. Shackle was the other major
site of old Indian influence on Luna, and with the
destruction of New Mumbai holds special importance
to descendants of the Indian diaspora. New Varanasi
is a monumental artificial cavern complex with an
intricate canal system fed by melted ice from the polar
caps above. As a source of lifegiving water, it now
holds the same importance to the hindu faith once
ascribed to the River Ganges on old Earth. Survivors
of other Indian religions, such as the jains and sikhs,
have also made their temples here. This makes Shackle
a major pilgrimage site; tourism is the major industry
after water extraction. A small herd of Indian
elephants is a major attraction, and the elephant god
Ganesha, Remover of Obstacles, is extremely popular
on Luna, even with non-hindus.



## MARS

Earth was the cradle of transhuman civilization, but
Mars, with a population of 200 million, is now its
heartland. When humanity began its spaceward diaspora,
Luna was its first stop. Yet while Luna boasts a
sizable population, Mars was the first world humans
settled where they could thrive entirely on locally
available resources. During the first few decades,
the early Martian settlers dwelt in tin can hab units,
extracting methane from the local atmosphere for
rocket fuel and water from the Martian permafrost,
farming in inflatable greenhouses, and eventually
manufacturing enough greenhouse gases to warm the
planetary climate to the point where transhumans
could walk the Martian surface unprotected, save for
oxygen respirators.

The second phase of the great project of
terraforming Mars—husbanding plant life and microbes
engineered to rapidly replace atmospheric carbon
dioxide with oxygen—was already underway at the
time of the Fall. A belt of orbital mirrors helps to heat
the planet by focusing the sun’s rays. The spread of
plant life is a long-term project that will take several
centuries to produce a fully breathable atmosphere,
but the nigh-immortal transhumans of Mars are prepared
to be patient. A new homeworld is worth the
wait. Research into new plants and micro-organisms
capable of releasing oxygen and nitrogen into the
Martian atmosphere at an ever-accelerating pace is a
major focus of economic activity.

In the meantime, the red planet is a place of startling
contrasts, from the stark beauty of its mountain
ranges and high desert to the slowly greening bottomlands
of the equatorial Valles Marineris canyon
system. In these bottomlands, oxygen levels are
slowly rising, and liquid water can now be found in
canals that had already been dry for millions of years
when transhumanity’s ancestors came down from
the trees. Mars is a popular destination for travelers
from around the system. Many Martians accrue
wealth by operating lavish hotels, offering tours of
historical sites, and leading wilderness expeditions to
the rugged highlands and vast deserts of the untamed
Martian frontier.

Mars now sports five vast, domed cities, mostly in
the equatorial regions, along with numerous smaller
settlements. Settlements are connected by surface
roads, a network of near-sonic maglev trains, and
air/spaceports from which suborbitals, airships, and
near space rockets fly on regular schedules. Thanks
to the abundance of methane fuel and gravity only
one-third of Earth’s, transhumans on Mars finally got
their flying cars as well, and all settlements have 
well-delineated rights-of-way for these vehicles. Meanwhile,
in the wild uplands, planetologists and terraforming
engineers dwell in small villages, living the simple life
in ruster morphs while seeing to the continued
development of the Martian climate and atmosphere.

As a partially terraformed planet with vast tracts
of unused land, Mars is one of the few places that
can offer new sleeves to infomorph refugees. Martian
brokerage houses do a brisk business in the purchase
and resale of infugee contract labor, with agreements
(for some) leading to eventual sleeving. This has led to
a sizable Martian underclass, however, organized as a
growing resistance movement under the Barsoomian
banner (though the hyperelite socialites disparagingly
call them “rednecks”).

### REGIONS

Mars is broadly divided between the lowlands of the
north and the highlands of the south, which in many
places are separated by dramatic cliffs up to two kilo-
meters high. Mars has seasons just as Earth, and both
north and south poles have permanent ice caps that
persist despite transhumanity’s success in warming the
planet. Both regions present obstacles to terraforming.
The northern plains are open and windswept, while
the rugged southern uplands remain a difficult terrain
for life to gain a foothold. Even so, tough Earth
species like cacti and succulents are able to grow in
the best spots.

#### Ma’adim Vallis: 

This deep canyon system on Mars
holds one of the Planetary Consortium’s most treasured
possessions: the Martian Gate. This Pandora gate
was originally discovered by nomadic Barsoomians,
then violently wrested from their hands by hypercorp
troops—an event that still rankles the rednecks. As
different hypercorps themselves nearly came to blows,
the Hypercorp Council was forced to step in and offer
a resolution that all could agree to. A new hypercorp
was founded—Pathfinder—which would control
exploration and exploitation of the gate and resources
beyond, with special privileges and rights given to
Planetary Consortium members. The Martian Gate is
now a staging point for numerous exoplanet colonies,
though some fear the prospect of keeping a presumed-TITAN
artifact operational on transhumanity’s most
populous planet.

#### Olympus Mons:

Mars’s most notable landmark is
the mighty shield volcano Olympus Mons, on which
the first—and still principle—Martian space elevator
was constructed. Similar in shape and origin to Earth’s
Hawaiian Islands, but now dormant, Olympus Mons
is one of the highest mountains in the solar system,
rising 27 kilometers.

Olympus, the settlement in the volcano’s caldera
around the base of the space elevator, was once the
chief city of Mars, but waned in popularity as a place
to live when terraforming made other regions more
attractive. A maglev train from Olympus takes a little
over three hours to reach Noctis; air travel is even
quicker. Despite the waning of the city, the space
elevator still sees heavy use.

#### Valles Marineris:

Most of transhumanity’s
terraforming efforts center around the winding Valles
Marineris canyonlands, which twist and turn over
4,000 kilometers east-to-west along the Martian
equator. In these relatively warm bottomlands, liquid
water is becoming abundant and the land is green
with hardy plant species like crab grass, dandelions,
and towering Douglas firs (which botanists estimate
may reach heights of 180 meters in the low Martian
gravity). 75% of the transhuman population of Mars
lives in this region, giving it the highest density of
transhuman habitation in the solar system.


#### The Zone:

Officially labeled the TITAN Quarantine Zone,
the TQZ is a large area stretching from the
smooth plains of Amazonis Planitia (between the
Tharsis and Elysium volcanic areas) and southeast to
Arsia Mons (just west of Noctis). This zone is known
to be crawling with leftover TITAN machinery:
warbots, nanoswarms, and other dangerous things.
Several devastated habitats lie in this region,
including the former Islamic stronghold of Qurain. Few
dare venture here, though some rumors suggest that
Barsoomian smugglers make use of the Arsia Mons
caves and even scavenge for TITAN tech, despite the
risks. Planetary Consortium drones keep a vigilant eye
on the Zone’s borders, though for unknown reasons
the TITAN relics rarely stray beyond its bounds.



### ASHOKA

Ashoka is located in a crater in the Ares Vallis region
about 3,000 kilometers northeast of Valles-New
Shanghai, not far from the landing sites of the early
Viking and Pathfinder probes. The town is a popular
spa and spiritual retreat for Martians wanting to
revisit their pioneer roots. It is also an active
terraforming station and a major point of contact between
the semi-nomadic Barsoomian culture of the high
desert and the settled Martians of the equatorial
canyonlands. 10,000 scientists, historians, terraforming
workers, and spiritual gurus live in the town and
surrounding area. A major attraction is a museum
housing the Pathfinder lander and the Sojourner rover
(which was still operational when humans landed and
discovered it circling endlessly in a crater). The Viking
lander is in another museum a short monorail ride
from town. In a move that infuriated historical purists,
all three machines were given modern hardware
upgrades when discovered and now house AIs who
act as historians of early Mars exploration. Sojourner
is particularly friendly and sometimes leads lucky
groups on walking tours of early landing sites.


### ELYSIUM

Located in the Elysium and Hyblaeus Chasma in
the north of the Hesperia region in Mars’s eastern
hemisphere, Elysium is the entertainment capital of
the system and the largest Martian city outside of
the canyonlands of the equator. It is also the most
physically remote of the large Martian cities, though
transhumanity’s advanced transportation technology
(suborbital flights and rocket flight from habitats
above) make this remoteness a trivial quality.

Elysium and Hyblaeus Chasma together make up
a 250-kilometer long canyon system in the shadow
of Elysium Mons, a 14-kilometer mountain located
about 200 kilometers northeast of the city. In between
is the Zephyrus Fossae, an undulating, windswept
lava plain. The city was the vision of one person,
Zevi Oaxaca-Maartens, an eccentric entertainment
magnate who was intrigued by the close proximity of
the eminently terraformable Chasma to the unspoiled
Hesperian terrain.

The city is only 30 years old but already boasts
a population of 9 million transhumans. Elysium is
mostly built into the canyon walls of the Chasma,
sprawling over a 75-kilometer stretch, all of which
has been domed over. Unlike the big domed metroplexes
of the south, Elysium takes advantage of the
canyon walls, which are close enough together that
rather than building free standing domes, the builders
have simply built great enclosing arches to completely
cover the canyon. These expand northward year by
year as the city grows. From low orbit, it looks like a
great, glistening serpent.

The Martian city of Elysium is the spiritual successor
to old Earth’s Los Angeles as the entertainment
capital of the solar system. Glamorous stars and
blood-drinking producers coupled with a healthy
dose of outrageous (if often vapid) transhuman
creativity have made Mars an unrivaled media powerhouse.
Elysium may boast more exalt and sylph
morphs per capita than any other transhuman city
Image is everything here, and to visitors it may seem
as if everyone in this city is either blindingly beautifu
or calculatedly ugly. The most successful performers
and entertainment tycoons live lives of glittering
privilege that would make the richest gerontocrat in
New Shanghai mildly envious. Everyone else, from
up-and-coming game producers to virtual ero performers,
has to hustle constantly.


### NOCTIS-QIANJIAO

With a population of 13 million, Noctis-Qianjiao is the
major metroplex in the west of the Valles Marineris
region, an area known as Noctis Labyrinthus.
Although not as hospitable as the Eos region in which
Valles-New Shanghai lies, Noctis Labyrinthus is
considered prime real estate for its gorgeous scenery and
well-developed river systems. The metroplex boasts
two major domes: Qianjiao, on the northern bank of
the River Noctis, and Noctis City (normally just called
“Noctis”) to the south. Connecting the two domes and
spanning the river is a sprawling network of lesser
domes and souks, although these have been pushed
north and south over the years as the planet warms
and the river grows wider.

Noctis-Qianjiao is the center of the Martian
design and fashion industries, which in the abundant
Martian economy arguably makes the city as important
as the much-larger Valles-New Shanghai. This
settlement’s proximity to the Zone sometimes alarms
visitors, but there have been no public incidents to
cause concern so far.

### MARTIAN MANHUNT

\[Incoming Message. Source: Anonymous\]<br>
\[Public Key Decryption Complete\]

Those deaths you asked me to look
into? It’s looking worse than we feared.

I took a buggy car out to the Zim settlement.
It’s just a collection of tin can modules,
supporting a small terraforming ecostation and
facilities for nomadic rednecks. On average,
it’s home to 150, if you count the 20 or so
pleasure pod AIs that serve as local “entertainment.”

A week ago, a nomad known as
Hassan Naceri rolled in. He’s a regular,
word is that he runs a lone courier service
for the Barsoomians. On this recent visit, though,
his behavior was off. He was nervous and agitated.
He told one drinking buddy that he’d been forced to hide
out in the Zone for a few days and the
experience had put him on edge.

Turns out Naceri had run off with a ruster morph without
working out his full indenture to Fa Jing a few years
back. The ego hunter showed up in Zim and Naceri lost it.
He killed the ego hunter and everyone else in the room.

We found a spime’s sensor records that show Naceri
transforming. He also killed half a dozen people by
simply looking at them.

That’s right. This bugger’s infected.

The Martian Rangers are hot on his  trail, but they don’t
know what they’re dealing with. So we’re off to try and
catch him—it—first. Wish us luck.


</blockquote>



### Olympus

Olympus, with a population of 1 million living
in a space designed to accommodate 6 million, is
something of a ghost town. The former principal
city, built in the caldera of Olympus Mons around
the space elevator, is now fallen into disuse. As the
temperatures rose and the climate improved in the
Valles Marineris canyonlands, most of the population
left the windswept caldera for more hospitable
surroundings. Olympus is not and never was a large
domed city, consisting instead of a souk-like network
of minor domes and antiquated tin can hab modules.
Low atmospheric pressure and bone-freezing temperatures
at the city’s altitude of 27 kilometers mean that
most transhumans venturing outside the souks and
hab modules still need the equivalent of light vacsuits
to survive. Martian Alpiners, a rare morph found in
few other places, are not uncommon here due to the
harsh conditions.

The city center is well maintained and carefully
overseen by the Olympus Infrastructure Authority,
a minor hypercorp that operates the space eleva-
tor. The outskirts are economically depressed and
sometimes dangerous, mostly deserted and populated
by squatters, indentured downloads on the
run, and other people who really want to be left
alone. Occasional outbreaks of dangerously mutated
artificial life are one of the few reasons for which
the Authority bothers to intervene in the outskirts.
Otherwise, the old tin can habs and their strange
inhabitants are left to decay.


### PROGRESS (DEIMOS)

Progress is one of the largest Cole bubbles in the
Solar System. With 8.5 million residents, it is second
in population only to Extropia in the belt. Progress
was created when Fa Jing evicted all of the former
residents from the Martian satellite of Deimos, excavated
the inside of the moonlet, and used a massive
solar array to convert it into a bubbleworld. From an
engineering standpoint, Progress is a wonder. It was
the first successful use of new methods to create a
Cole habitat after several previous attempts to create
bubbleworlds resulted in the asteroid or moonlet
breaking apart.

Progress is nonetheless an impressive habitat, home
to hypercorp glitterati and an outpost for a host of
major political and economic concerns. Its sister
moon, Phobos, remains a warren-like tunnel habitat
due to the presence of multiple legal interests unable
to agree upon the disposal of the satellite.

### VALLES-NEW SHANGHAI

The principal city of Mars, Valles-New Shanghai is
transhumanity’s largest planetary metroplex, with 37
million inhabitants. Valles-New Shanghai lies in the
heavily terraformed Eos region in the east of the Valles
Marineris canyon system. The metroplex is comprised
of five major domes connected by a network of
Martian souks. The souks are a unique architectural
feature of large Martian cities, consisting of covered
thoroughfares and galleries lined with bazaars, eateries,
and squats. It is said one can find anything if one
spends enough time walking the souks.

The domes themselves are tamer, with artificia
waterways (many of which now connect to the
tenuous rivers etching the surface of the Eosian
bottomland), grand architecture, residential mini-arcologies,
entertainment complexes, and hypercorp
conference centers. The most impressive by far is the
Bund, the larger and older of two domes making up
the city of New Shanghai proper. New Shanghai is
roughly bisected by the twisting Ares, an artifical river
that helps regulate the dome’s climate. Near its center
is an almost brick-for-brick duplicate of the original
Bund from the destroyed Earth city of Shanghai.

The other four domes are Little Shanghai (a newer,
smaller dome adjacent to the Bund), Valles Center
(a business and financial center that rivals the Lunar
banks of Erato and Nectar), New Pittsburgh (also
called the Burgh, a hub of research and planet-side
industry), and Nytrondheim (housing major entertainment districts).

Valles-New Shanghai is transhumanity’s wealthiest
population center, a hotbed of art and culture, and
one of the system’s great centers of hypercorp activity.
The populace includes an extremely high percentage
of gerontocrats, but their stifl ng influ nce on
culture, economic mobility, and the legal system is
only one force among many in a city of 37 million
people. The city has expanded so much to accommodate
its exploding population since the Fall that
new construction is a constant. Crime and corruption
are widespread, though the worst of it is contained
to Little Shanghai. Valles is a place where dreams are
made and broken every day, if not every hour.


## MARTIAN TROJANS

Not to be confused with the much larger Jovian
Trojans, the Martian Trojans are a small group of
mostly rocky asteroids trailing and preceding Mars at
its L4 and L5 points.


### QING LONG (AZURE DRAGON)

Qing Long, with a population of 2 million, is the
largest O’Neill habitat in the system. It is situated
among the Trojans at the Martian L5 point. Qing
Long has its roots in the Chinese effort to colonize
Mars. Despite its exceptional size, it is one of the
oldest habitats of its type, having been built almost
entirely from metal-rich asteroids mined near its
present location.

Qing Long is a major underworld haven. The habitat’s
administration is beholden to several criminal
organizations who normally refrain from killing one
another. The habitat nominally obeys some hypercorp
principles, such as limited access to cornucopia
machines, forking, and AGIs. However, thriving grey
and black markets enable people with the right
connections to acquire just about anything here.




## ASTEROID BELT

Spread out over a massive region between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, the Main Belt contains a few
hundred asteroids greater than 100 kilometers in
diameter, over a thousand objects greater than 30 kilometers
in size, and countless smaller ones. Despite this,
the total mass of asteroids in the belt is only a fraction
of one of the inner planets, meaning that asteroids are
spread out over great distances. A spacecraft flyin
through the belt is highly unlikely to encounter an
asteroid unless it deliberately navigates toward it.

### RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS

The rich, easily accessible mineral deposits in the
Belt were a major link in transhumanity’s first steps
toward the outer system. Automated mining and
high-impulse ion boosters enabled outer system
colonists to move metal-rich Main Belt asteroids
into the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond, where
metallic asteroids are much scarcer. This activity
continues to this day as transhumanity pushes
further out into the system.


### HABITATS

Hundreds of small habitats, mostly involved in
prospecting activities, dot the belt. Distant from Earth,
settlements in the belt were largely spared the
devastation of the Fall. Both hypercorp and autonomous
outposts flourish here. Derelict habitats abandoned
when nearby asteroids were boosted into the outer
system or depleted are common here as well, though
some of these are now occupied by residents who are
best left to their solitude.


### CERES

One of the system’s dwarf planets (along with the
likes of Pluto and Eris), Ceres is almost 1,000 kilometers
in diameter and hosts a population of almost a
million. Unlike most Main Belt asteroids, Ceres has an
icy crust with a layer of liquid water beneath it, like
a miniature version of Jupiter’s moon, Europa. With
its abundant water, Ceres has a major role in resupplying
other stations in the belt. Similar to Extropia,
Ceres operates largely along anarcho-capitalist lines.
However, the Hidden Concern, a cartel run entirely
by uplifted octopi, holds sway in the sub-crustal sea
and maintains a stranglehold, as it were, on water
extraction operations. Cerean octopoid morphs are
specially adapted to survive in the ammonia-rich
waters of the Hidden Sea.

### EXTROPIA (44 NYSA)

This massive beehive habitat is a major crossroads
and anarcho-capitalist/mutualist marketplace.
Extropia is a neutral free city whose infrastructure
and social fabric is maintained by a loose association
of anarcho-syndicalist affinity groups. Extropia’s
neutrality hinges on strategic alliances between key
local figures their networks, and an unusual array
of outside interests that include the Lunar banks,
technolibertarian factions, and outer system colonies
dependent upon raw materials exported from the
belt. The hypercorps use Extropia as a tax shelter and
a haven from which to do illicit business. There are
no laws or government as such; visitors are advised
to register with an insurance and security provider.
Named after one of the first transhumanist movements,
Extropia is considered a utopia for transhumans
looking for body modifications AGIs and
forking are accepted and allowed here. The
transhuman population is nearly ten million.

### NOVA YORK (METIS)

One of the more unusual near-weightless habitats is
Nova York, the main city on Metis, a large nickel-iron
and silicate asteroid located in the main belt. Nova
York, the third largest habitat in the main belt, is a
thriving metropolis of 500,000, with the main portion
of the city located in a spherical cavern approximately
four kilometers in diameter, the top of which is two
hundred meters beneath the asteroid’s surface. Lit
during the day by a series of huge light tubes in the
outer walls, at night the lights of the buildings cause
the surface of this sphere to resemble an enormous
geode. The habitat’s basic design consists of many
thousands of exceptionally tall and fragile-looking
buildings that extend between one hundred and fifteen
hundred meters above the surface, as well as a few
buildings that stretch from one side of the cavern to
the other. In Metis’s minute gravity of 1/140th of a g,
up and down have little meaning, and even relatively
fragile buildings are in no danger of falling down. The
vast majority of the buildings, including ones more
than one kilometer tall, are made from thin plastic
panels over a durable supporting framework. These
buildings jut out at all angles from the sphere.

Many inhabitants of Nova York move from one
building to another by jumping, and a single leap can
carry someone many hundreds of meters. Residents
do not worry about falling—the combination of air
resistance and exceedingly low gravity means that
even someone falling from the top of the cavern to
the bottom is in no danger of injury. In this
environment, the only real meaning of up and down is that
down is where you look for objects to come to rest
(as long as an air current does not pick them up and
blow them around).


## JUPITER

Large enough that it could almost have formed the
nucleus of a protostar in its own right, Jupiter’s
massive size makes the Jovian system one of the most
challenging places in the system to colonize. Jupiter’s
powerful magnetic field means that its inner moons—and
the outer ones, when their orbits pass through its
immense magnetotail—are bombarded with enough
ionizing radiation to kill transhumans not protected
by the heaviest of shielding within a matter of hours.
There are sixty-three moons and moonlets in the
Jovian system, but only the well-explored, populous,
regular moons are described here.


### RESOURCES AND ECONOMY

Jupiter’s powerful gravity well is a major hindrance to
gas mining in the planet’s atmosphere, as even craft
that do not succumb to the violent, centuries-long
atmospheric storms can only achieve escape velocity
with the most powerful propulsion systems. Given the
need for heavy shielding on such craft, gas mining on
Jupiter is not nearly as effi ient as on Saturn. Jupiter
has a tenuous ring system, much less dense than
Saturn’s, which extends out for 20,000 kilometers
around the planet, encompassing the orbits of its two
closest moonlets.

Jupiter’s gravity, however, is also a valuable
resource. Craft bound for Saturn and beyond can
slingshot themselves outward by circling the planet
to pick up velocity, cutting months or years off their
trips. The heavily militarized Jovian Republic levies
tolls against all spacecraft using Jupiter’s gravity to
pick up velocity, including asteroids under propulsion.
This protection money is the Junta’s primary source of
revenue. Planetary Consortium ships generally accept
the payment as part of operating expenses. Other factions
are not so cooperative, and the Junta regularly
seizes or destroys blockade runners.


### HABITATS AND MOONLETS

Most of Jupiter’s moons are really captured asteroids,
lacking the size and geological complexity of planetary
bodies. All are occupied. Some were converted
to habitats; others host only Junta military and mining
outposts. The Jovian moonlets consist mostly of carbonaceous
rock, poor in metal, with some of the larger
moonlets having layers or even cores of ice. Beehive
habitats and Reagan cylinders predominate in the
Jovian system. Reagan cylinders (called “sarcophagus
habs” by other factions) are an inefficient variation on
the O’Neill cylinder in which excavators hollow out
an immense, cylindrical cavern in a rocky asteroid and
then alter the asteroid’s rotation with external
thrusters to simulate gravity.

Other habitat types are rare in Jovian orbit,
especially within 2 million kilometers of the planet,
where the radiation is strongest. For a bioconservative
faction unwilling to adopt radiation-resistant
morphs, the Junta is in a poor location. Shielding their
populace beneath tons of rock is a necessity. Despite
its military hegemony, the Junta can’t control all of
Jovian space, and there are things it can’t do on its
own—like exploring Europa. A number of unaligned
habitats and surface settlements exist in the ring
system and the orbits of the Galilean moons.

The Jovian Republic has renamed Jupiter’s moons
after various neo-conservative heroes from Earth’s
history. From closest to most distant, the moonlets are
Metis (Bush), Adrastea (Fairway), Amalthea (Solano),
Thebe (McAllen), Leda (Chung), Himalia (Pinochet),
Lysithea (Friedman), Elara (Buckley), Ananke (Nixon),
Carme (Kissinger), Pasiphae (Schilling), and Sinope
(Garcia). All are tiny, between 5 and 100 kilometers
in diameter.


### AMALTHEA (SOLANO)

The largest of the moonlets, hollow Amalthea is probably
the most livable sarcophagus habitat due to the
large lake created from its icy core. Living on Solano
carries some prestige among Junta citizens. Rumor has
it that most of the residents are well-placed RAND
think tank personnel, most of whom work on defense
projects. A fusion-powered axial light tube illuminates
the 30-kilometer diameter central cavern, whose
landscape is patterned after the subdivisions and offic
parks of an early 21st-century suburb. All buildings
have envirosealing so that the occasional bouts of
environmental sepsis resulting from the poorly regulated
interior ecosystem can be purged with toxin bombs.
Less-fortunate support personnel dwell in the beehive
warrens crisscrossing the moonlet’s crust between
cavern and surface. Like most of Jupiter’s moonlets,
Amalthea’s space crawls with patrol craft and killsats,
making approach for unauthorized ships problematic
at best. 1.5 million transhumans live on Solano.

### IO

Beneath Io’s tenuous, patchy atmosphere of volcanic
gases and neutral atomic dust lies a barren, grayish
yellow, rocky surface coated with a thin frost of sulfur
dioxide. Tidal heating caused by gravitational
interaction with Jupiter makes Io the most volcanically
active body in the system—so active that the meteor
cratering found on every other planet and moon is
completely absent on Io. Massive volcanic calderas,
lakes of molten rock, and geysers of sulfur dot the
surface, with eruptions and accompanying seismic
activity lasting months or years. Volcanic zones on
Io reach surface temperatures of up to 1,500 Kelvin,
hotter than any body in the system.

For all that, transhumanity’s worst peril on Io is
radiation. Ejecta from geysers and volcanoes flo
with Jupiter’s magnetic field to form a titanic, toroidal
flux tube that rotates with Io around the gas giant.
Travelers to Io must either use the heaviest radiation
shielding available or resleeve into synthetic morphs.

Transhuman activity on Io centers around scientific
research and harvesting the volatiles ejected by Io’s
geysers, particularly sulfur. Bases tend to be modular
and mobile due to the ever-changing seismic activity.
The Junta’s most notorious prison, Maui Patera
Rehabilitation Center, is dug into a (mostly) extinct
caldera wall north of the equator.

## EUROPA

Europa has no atmosphere and lies within the fearsome
magnetosphere of Jupiter. Its surface is bombarded
with enough radiation for an unshielded
transhuman to receive an irrevocably fatal dosage
within a few days—much faster when Europa’s orbit
passes through Jupiter’s immense magnetotail. As a
result, transhumans on Europa dwell beneath the icy
crust, largely in the ocean below, adopting a variety of
aquatic and amphibious morphs for survival. The only
surface facilities are the heavily shielded ice elevator
heads at Conamara Chaos and several other points
through which reactor mass and other crucial supplies
can be delivered to the Europans below.

Transhumanity is still exploring and imaging the
Europan ocean floo , a task complicated by the hideous
pressures at work in these waters, which are ten times
as deep as the Earth’s oceans. A further surprise
awaiting transhumanity was the terrain. The geology of
Europa suggested that beneath the ice would be fathomless
depths of black water ending at a depth of nearly
500 kilometers in a relatively flat featureless sea bed.
Were Europa a lifeless ball of ice and rock, this would
be the case, but over the estimated billion years since
the rise of life on Europa, tiny lithoderms (analogs to
Earth’s coral) have built silicate reefs that rise to within
a few hundred meters of the ice crust. It is on these
biologically formed mountain tops, home to complex
ecosystems, that the Europans have built their habitats.

While based on water-carbon chemistry like life of
Earth origin, life on Europa is completely autocthonic,
having originated beneath an impenetrable ice sheet
that cut off Europa’s subsurface ocean completely
from outside. This is in marked contrast to Earth life,
which some biologists have theorized might be the
result of galactic panspermia, the slow diffusion of
microbes through the vacuum of space aboard comets
or asteroids. As such, the fauna of Europa are of great
interest to transhuman bioscience.

### BIOSCIENCES

Europa’s life forms, unique perhaps in the universe,
are its greatest treasure, and transhumanity’s efforts
to catalog them are only beginning. The rush to
exploit Europan biodivesity puts the Jovian Junta in
an uncomfortable situation. While they control space
traffic and commerce in the Jovian system, they lack
the native talent to take real advantage of knowledge
gleaned from Europa. At first, they engaged in
hamfisted excise operations aimed at squeezing revenue
out of knowledge exports. But once farcasters and
egocasters came online below the ice, this type of
extortion no longer worked. Now the Jovians have
shifted to a two-pronged strategy of levying tariffs
on new equipment and people brought down the ice
elevators by hypercorps and research collectives, and
of holding the entire population of the moon hostage
by refusing delivery of key resources like reactor mass
and rare elements if protection fees are not paid.

### HABITATS

Europan habitats take two forms: fortified fishing and
farming havens clinging to the spires of the lithodermic
reefs and spherical bubble warrens constructed
by boring into the lower reaches of the ice crust and
shoring up the hollows created. The latter are the only
air-filled spaces beneath the ice. The largest warren
is Conamara, at the base of the Conamara Chaos ice
elevator. Conamara is surrounded by five nearby reef
havens, also considered part of the habitat. The total
population is 1.5 million.


## GANYMEDE AND CALLISTO

Larger in size than Luna, but darkly colored and not
as heavily cratered, Ganymede and Callisto are very
similar worlds. Neither is as dense (nor has as much
gravity), as their mantles consist of more ice than
iron rock. Both possess abundant volatiles and water
(albeit frozen), making them ideal candidates for
habitation. Ganymede, with its differentiated surface
of rocky and icy terrain, has an iron core and thus a
faint magnetic field Callisto, the smaller of the two,
is composed mostly of icy silicate clays. As on Luna,
most cities on Ganymede and Callisto are built below
ground to shield them from meteor impacts (and, on
Ganymede, from Jupiter’s radioactive bombardment).

While within the “protection” of the Jovian
Republic, both moons are a patchwork of city-states.
Some are full members of the Jovian polity, while
others are only tolerated. Ganymede tends to swing
more heavily toward the Junta, as its citizens still
see the Junta-maintained infrastructure—accurately
or not—as necessary in such a hostile environment.
Callisto, outside the worst radioactive effects of the
Jovian magnetosphere, is an easier place for techno-
progressivism to gain a foothold.

### HYODEN

The nucleus of this city-state was a research station
founded by a coalition of Pacific Rim nations in
Callisto’s Valhalla region, a massive primordial
impact zone where the icy subsurface lies exposed,
simplifying extraction of clean water. When the Fall
came, Hyoden, which had long faced labor shortages,
opened itself to those refugees who could make
it to Jupiter. Now Hyoden has 2 million inhabitants,
making it the largest city-state on Callisto and the
largest non-Junta state in the Jovian system. Hyoden
is itself heavily militarized, as the tendency of the local
authorities to turn a blind eye toward operatives using
their territory for forays against the Junta makes for
uneasy relations with their powerful neighbor.

### LIBERTY

Situated along the southern edge of the vast, rocky
plain called Galileo Regio, almost on Ganymede’s
equator, Liberty (population 7 million) is the Junta’s
largest planetary city-state. It is closely tied to Liberty
Station, a major shipyard and defense installation in
geosynchronous orbit. Major industries include ship-
building, space construction, fabrication, and security
products and services. The Castle, the central security
network point from which all surveillance data collected
in the Junta is monitored and processed, is
rumored to be in or near Liberty. Liberty is mostly
underground, but it boasts a number of parks in
armored surface domes. If one were to spend enough
time topside, one would see the deceleration torches
of incoming metal asteroids from the belt bound for
the shipyards lighting up the sky several times a day.

## THE TROJANS (JOVIAN TROJAN AND GREEK ASTEROIDS)

The Trojans and Greeks are two 600 million kilometer-long
arcs of scattered, icy-rock asteroids sharing
the orbit of Jupiter. They orbit in the stable L4 and
L5 points sixty degrees ahead of and behind the giant
planet. Mars and Neptune also have Trojan asteroids,
but when someone speaks of “the Trojans” they’re
normally talking about the Jovian groups. In the early
days, L4 asteroids (ahead of Jupiter) were named after
Greek heroes of Homer’s Iliad; L5 asteroids (trailing
Jupiter) were named after heroes of Troy. Asteroids
discovered more recently break the old convention, as
there are far more objects in the Trojans than there
were characters in the Iliad.

Politically, the Trojans and Greeks may be thought
of as a collection of sometimes overlapping
neighborhoods whose inhabitants tend to group around
particular cultures, factions, and sometimes languages.
A neighborhood in the Trojans might span anywhere
from 250,000 to 2 million kilometers at its widest
point. Within neighborhoods, almost everyone knows
one other. Because of the wide dispersion of resources,
Trojan habitats tend to be small—from one to two
thousand people—and built largely along scum barge
or cluster lines (although it is never advisable to refer
to someone’s habitat as a scum barge unless they refer
to it that way first)

### RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS

Although the sheer size of the two regions means a
lot of cultural diversity, anarcho-collectivism is a
powerful meme here and the reputation economy
is prevalent. On one hand, neighborhoods, habitats,
and even individuals are expected to be self-sufficient
Unlike the denser Main Belt, the Trojans lack the
safety net provided by pervasive transhuman presence.
The ideal Trojan or Greek is a Neo-Renaissance
being, incredibly competent in a wide variety of fields
A person who can’t maneuver in zero g; maintain
their gear, ship, and hab; and navigate between rocks
and habitats can have a tough time surviving. At the
same time, a spirit of cooperation prevails. Bartering
services or even gifting them to gain reputation is
common. Everyone appreciates a specialist, as long
as they’re not specialized at the expense of baseline
self-sufficienc .

Prospecting and salvage are major activities in the
Trojans, where metals and rare elements are scarce
and settlers don’t usually have the economic muscle
to import raw materials from elsewhere. However,
the Trojans are rich in silicates, volatiles, and
carbonaceous materials. Necessity has led to many
innovations in materials science. Beyond the simple problem
of raw materials, the widely scattered habitats of the
Trojans have to be wildly inventive on many levels
to retain their independence. New robot, morph,
and vehicle designs appear all the time, enabling an
unusual array of business and leisure activities, like
whaling (organizing a flash flotilla to rapidly mine
asteroids and comets with erratic orbits as they pass
near the Trojans), mekking (simulated—or sometimes
real—combat between robotic suits or synthetic
morphs on uninhabited asteroids with interesting
terrain), and shrining (stealthing up on another
habitat and resurfacing it with nanosculpters to
create an art object—mostly a scum barge pastime).

## LOCUS

Locus is the largest cluster habitat ever formed. It
is still growing, with over one million inhabitants
in the habitat proper and another million in the
nearby suburbs of scum barges and small asteroid
stations. Locus is located in Cassandra’s Reach, one
of the denser regions in the L5 Trojans. The habitat
is positioned at the center of mass around which the
two asteroids making up the binary object Patroclus
orbit one another. Both Patroclus asteroids are
themselves inhabited and hold defense installations,
mines, and refineries

The design of Locus is very similar to the much
smaller Lot 49, but Locus is eleven kilometers in
diameter and somewhat irregular in shape, as growth
along some spars is faster than others. A quarter of its
total volume is cut out in a roughly conical shape all
the way to the Amoeba, an immense, softly glowing
sculpture at the center of the habitat. Some differences
from smaller Trojan clusters are dictated by
Locus’s size. The immense structural spars radiating
from the habitat’s center are hollow, with arterial
floatways and elevator-trams running inside of them.
Lesser spars run between the arterial spars, providing
more mooring points for modules. Adjacent to each
arterial spar are wide “roads” leading to the edge of
the habitat so that modules can maneuver out if the
owners decide to leave.

Beneath the shimmering mesh stretched over the
geodesic frame to keep out micro-asteroids, tens of
thousands of small ships and habitat modules moored
along the spars pulse with an ever-changing array of
lights. Habitat modules and large ships are asked
to stay out of the conical empty space. This space
teems with small craft and people on thrustpacks
or voidscooters as they cross the habitat, play zero-g
games, or visit the free-floating spimes and sculptures
that dot the area. The Amoeba, which periodically
changes color and shape based on its resident AI’s
programming (often it looks like some sort of animal),
serves as a central reference point for navigation.
When someone gives the address for a module, it is
as a point on a spherical coordinate system with the
Amoeba at its center. Large ships and shuttles dock on
the outer surface of the habitat, at the terminal points
of the arterial spars.

Locus was founded by a joint anarchist-argonaut
venture and was the first major stronghold for the
autonomist factions. Unlike Extropia, which has
the tacit blessing of the Planetary Consortium and
encourages the presence of security and insurance
companies, Locus runs on a pure reputation
economy. Security, maintenance, expansion, and
defense of the habitat are all performed by volunteers.
Inhabitants interested in security monitor
incoming ships and operate crowdsourcing systems
that dispatch volunteers to perform WMD scans on
new arrivals. Ships that won’t submit to a scan are
asked to leave. If they don’t, anyone who’s designed
a cool new weapons system recently is welcome to
take a shot.

Locus is a focal point in the cold war between the
hypercorp-aligned inner system powers and a loose
coalition of outer system interests. While saboteurs
from the Planetary Consortium and other hostile entities
can and do occasionally cause trouble on Locus,
the hypercorps are currently unwilling to attempt a
direct military attack on the habitat. The first time
they tried, the Planetary Consortium and the Martian
city-state of Valles-New Shanghai sent a small
expeditionary fleet The interlopers were caught completely
off-guard by a fierce and well-coordinated defense.
Six months later, they sent a much larger fleet. Help
arrived from elsewhere in the Trojans and Greeks
and from Titan, whose citizens took a dim view of
any Planetary Consortium expansion beyond the belt.
The Titanians now maintain a permanent base near
Locus. Rumor has it they agreed to a mutual defense
pact with one of Locus’s citizens, possibly the famous
programmer-armsman Teilhard Liu.

### LOT 49

Lot 49 is moored to the small asteroid 28349 Pynchon
in the amorphous Vonarburg-Shadyside neighborhood,
toward the center of the L4 Greeks. Vonarburg-Shadyside
is named after two rocks that roughly
delimit its 500,000-kilometer length along the arc of
Jupiter’s orbit. Neighboring habitats within 100,000
kilometers (with populations) include Craftsbury
(450), Greenview (28), and Blackhawk (1020). With a
population of 400, this station is more or less typical
of the Trojans in terms of layout.

From the outside, Lot 49 looks like a shiny,
meshed-over geodesic sphere, 800 meters in diameter,
with numerous protruding instrument spars and some
triangles left open to space so that shuttles can pass
through. The mooring to the asteroid is temporary in
case a potential collision is detected. Inside, a central
utility module with a communal reactor, factories,
and machine bay is surrounded by evenly spaced but
irregularly shaped habitat modules in a riot of colors
and lighting schemes. Structural spars and floatway
connect everything. One entire spar is given over to a
rotating cylindrical module that generates about 0.7 g
and contains medical, cloning, resleeving, and darknet
egocasting facilities.

Lot 49’s population and most of their neighbors
in Vonarburg-Shadyside tend to align with the scum
and anarchist factions and speak a mixture of English,
Portuguese, and Thai. Lot 49 is in a densely inhabited
part of the Greeks, placing it near a crossroads. Main
economic activities include shuttle design, whaling,
and ferrying people and goods around the region.


## SATURN

The second largest planet in the system is a much
more favorable habitat for transhumans than Jupiter.
Saturn’s lower gravity and milder magnetosphere are a
boon to gas mining operations, and for resource-hungry
habs, the rings are a feast (literally, in the case of
the new Hamilton cylinder type habitats). Hypercorps
have a presence here, but any major expansion by
the Planetary Consortium is kept in check by the
anarchist stations of the rings and the technosocialist
commonwealth of Titan.

Because Saturn is so distant from the sun, solar
power generation is extremely inefficient Growing
photosynthetic plants with sunlight is impossible
without large arrays of mirrors to focus the light. The
abundance of water and volatiles makes the rings
ideal for both scum barges and Hamilton cylinders.
Gas mining is vital to the survival of almost every
habitat and moon settlement in the Saturnian system,
so habitats located further out from the planet that
wish to be self-sufficient almost always maintain their
own gas mining stations close to the planet. Security
for these installations and the atmospheric skimmers
and tankers they dispatch is tight, and it is never
advisable to approach one unannounced.


### RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS

Gas mining on Saturn supplies 30 percent of the system’s
reactor mass. This role is expected to grow as
helium-3 deposits in the Lunar regolith become less
accessible. For ships traveling to the far reaches of
the outer system, Saturn is an important alternative
to using Jupiter for gravity assists. Less restrictive
than Jovian regimes and richer in resources than the
Trojans, Circumsaturnine habs and settlements are
important innovators in habitat design and cultural
organization. Since the discovery of the Pandora gates,
the Titanian Commonwealth is the only entity actively
pursuing interstellar exploration through conventional means.


### THE RINGS AND CLASSICAL MINOR MOONS

Saturn’s rings are made up of countless small icy
objects, most of which range in size from dust specks
to boulders 10 meters in diameter. The rings are
designated by the letters “A” through “F” in the order in
which they were discovered. They vary in thickness
between 100 and 1,000 meters and in width from
20,000 kilometers down to just meters. In places there
are gaps between rings. The widest, the Cassini division,
is 4,000 kilometers across.

Saturn has over 60 satellites, a number
that jumps into the hundreds if one
includes the uncounted objects less than
a kilometer across orbiting in the A ring.
Most of Saturn’s moons are small, rocky,
ice objects less than 100 kilometers in
diameter. The smallest of the classical
moons, Pan, is only 10 kilometers across.
The first eight moons, from Enceladus
inward, lie within the ring system. Atlas,
at the edge of the A ring, and Prometheus
and Pandora, which flank the thin F ring,
are known as the shepherd moons. Several
of the moonlets occupy Lagrange points
relative to larger moons. Telesto and
Calypso share the orbit of much larger
Tethys, while Helene trails another large
moon, Dione.

### GATE EXPEDITION REPORT 901127

Gate Code Setting: \[Encrypted\] <br>
Gatekeeper Corporation Eyes Only

Preliminary drone and sensor
reports indicate the gate’s exoplanet
environs were underground in a cavern
formed of carbonaceous rock with a
nitrogen dioxide atmosphere. There
were no signs of life or sapient activity.
A squad of gatecrashers was sent
through, guided by an exploration
drone, with a communication link back
to the gate.

Approximately one hour after
the team moved into the tunnels,
consistent communication was lost
due to electromagnetic interference. At
this point they had reported nothing
more notable than moving just over a
kilometer through a warren of tunnels.

The team was not heard from again.

Two hours after contact was lost, a
tethered search-and-rescue drone was
deployed. Following the gatecrashers’
breadcrumb trail, the drone came
upon what appeared to be a severed
hand in a vacsuit glove near the limits
of its tether range. DNA testing did
not identify the hand as belonging to
any members of the team, however,
nor did it match any other database
queries. The drone was detached from
its tether to search further, but shortly
after sensors recorded some type of
seismic event and communication with
the drone was also lost.

The gate was kept active for 8
more hours—the duration of the
contract—with no sign of activity.
The gate was then closed, the team
reported as lost/unretrievable, and the
gate settings were recorded with an
orange flag.

### ATLAS (VOLKOGRAAD)

Volkov, a Slavic energy cartel, controls
this tiny moon. Volkograad is a beehive
habitat with about 50,000 residents.
Much of the moon is given over to skimming,
refining and shipping infrastructure.
A cloud of wreckage trailing the moonlet
by about 100,000 kilometers serves as a
reminder of the Atlas Incident, a brief but
massively destructive battle that erupted
when Fa Jing attempted a buyout of the
moon. Tinkers from Phelan’s Recourse
still salvage the floating derelicts regularly.

### DIONE (THOROUGHGOOD)

Dione’s main settlement is Thoroughgood
(population 350,000), a hybrid beehive
and orbital cluster habitat set on a plateau
amid a dramatic range of ice cliffs. Dione
hosts the Long Array, a 150 kilometer-high
communications spar ascending
from the surface settlement to an orbital
station that acts as a counterweight. The
Long Array’s sheer size is something of a
publicity stunt, as the bulk of its capacity
goes unused. However, it drew enough
attention to make Thoroughgood a
major communications hub for the outer
system, and thus a place where hypercorp,
anarchist, and other factional interests
meet. Dione shares its orbit with Helene,
a tiny, rocky moon at its L4 point, and
Polydeuces, an even smaller body that
trails it at the L5 point.

### ENCELADUS (PROFUNDA)

Rich in organic compounds, Enceladus
is a biochemist’s playground. Profunda
(population 850,000) is the major
settlement, a beehive dug into the moon’s
surface capped by domed parks and clusters
of sleek, translucent minarets—well
protected from collisions by an aggressive
satellite defense network. The lower
levels, stretching deep into Enceladus’s
icy silicate mantle, include a prospecting
operation that extracts carbonaceous soils
in search of exotic compounds. Another
deep section has been converted into a
kilometers-wide, reactor-heated primordial
sea, part of a long-term experiment
into the origins of life supported jointly
by Titanian academics and a collective of
Enceladian biochemists.

Profunda is run along anarcho-​capitalist lines.
Thanks to the rich supply
of organic chemicals, its upper reaches are
home to many of the outer system’s best-known
morph designers. The Enceladian
Glitter Bloc is said to have as much inflence
over body styles as the Lunar fashion
houses do over what people wear.


### EPIMETHUS AND JANUS (TWELVE COMMONS)

These twin small, icy moonlets share virtually
the same path around Saturn, orbiting
within 50 kilometers of each other. Set
between the F and G Rings, the moonlets
form the center of Twelve Commons, a
neighborhood of small and mid-size
habitats arranged in a flat cloud about
20,000 kilometers in radius. About six
million people live in Twelve Commons.
Habitats in Twelve Commons range in
size from **Dang Fish Echo**, a tin can hab
housing about 60 eccentric aquaculturists,
to **Janus Common**, a beehive occupying
much of Janus with a population of
900,000. Some of the habitats in Twelve
Commons feature very unusual designs,
such as **Nguyen’s Compact** (population
80,000), a variant Cole habitat in the
G ring where an asteroid was heated
and large amounts of steam were blown
through it to produce a series of interconnected
bubbles between five and three
hundred meters in diameter. In effect, the
interior of the colony is like a solidifie
foam or Swiss cheese with no obvious up
or down. Without an ecto or basic implant
to provide location and navigation information,
navigating through this maze-like
habitat would be exceedingly difficult

The habitats of Twelve Commons
organize themselves primarily along open-source
anarcho-syndicalist lines, with
work groups and research pods acting as
the basic political unit.


### GATEWAY (PANDORA)

The Gateway settlement, on Saturn’s outer shepherd
moon Pandora, holds the first publicly known wormhole
gate. The Gatekeeper Corporation keeps the
gate open as a means of exploration and scientifi
investigation for all factions and powers. Gatekeeper
was originally a Titanian microcorp but is now independent.
The Commonwealth of Titan still holds a
major stake in it, though not a controlling interest.
Granting autonomy to Gatekeeper Corporation was
a diplomatic maneuver made in response to Planetary
Consortium claims that the Titanians sought hegemony
in the outer system. So far, Titan’s neighbors are
buying it, even if the Planetary Consortium doesn’t.

### HYPERION

With its chaotic, virtually unpredictable rotation,
Hyperion is a dangerous place to land ships. It
remains uninhabited.


### IAPETUS

Iapetus is one of Saturn’s larger icy moons and once
boasted a population of 200,000 living in the dense
warrens of Analect, its main settlement. Probably
because it is one of the few large moons of Saturn that
contains sizable deposits of silicates and minerals in
addition to ice, Iapetus was a target of the TITANs
during the Fall. After enslaving a tenth of the populace
as worker drones and using the rest as seed stock
for tissue cultures to feed their fellows, the TITANs
began to build what appears to have been a Jupiter
brain, turning the entire moon into a computational
structure. Iapetus now occupies twice the volume
it once did, the ice and silicate of the planet’s outer
layers having been reworked into a delicate lattice of
circuitry millions of layers deep.

Strangely, the project simply stalled at some point
prior to completion. Speculation is that the controlling
intelligence was either destroyed by an unknown
outside force or devoured itself in a fit of
computational ecstasy. Whatever the case, the drones simply
stopped working and died and the moon’s automated
defense grid went dead, leaving a strangely beautiful
but lifeless machine behind to slowly decay from
meteor impacts and gravitational stress. Several
research teams now reside in small orbital stations,
quarreling over the scraps. Rumor has it that a
number of scientists trying to understand the Jupiter
brain circuitry have lost their minds in the process,
perhaps by some mechanism akin to a basilisk hack.
It is also believed that some of the moon’s internal
defenses remain active. If anyone has plumbed the
interior and come back, they’re not talking about it.

### MEATHAB

The full name of this unique habitat is Turn Yourself
Into a Giant Mass of Space Meat for Art!, and as the
name implies, 90% of the habitat’s structure consists
of fast-cultured vat bacon, battened on the abundant
resources of the ring system. MeatHab started
out as someone’s art morph, but then, against all
expectations, squatters moved in. MeatHab now has
a population of 500. Similar to a Hamilton cylinder,
the kilometer-long habitat harvests and processes ring
material to grow itself. The outer surface is frozen
flesh ten meters thick whose surface resembles a cross
between a tree trunk and flank steak. Past the axial
space dock is a warren of veinous, skin-covered corridors
lit by bioluminescent panels and maintained by
small, reptilian symbiotes that eat away dead skin and
may have other immune functions as well. Gravity
inside is 0.5 g.

The nameless biodesigner who created the place—and
who may or may not still inhabit the gigantic
morph—was a genius. Although the habitat is not
by any stretch of the imagination a pleasant locale, it
appears healthy. Its full workings are not understood,
and the inhabitants range from extreme flesh freaks
who are fans of the artist to serious biodesigners
studying the place to learn more about its construction.

### MIMAS (HARMONIOUS ANARCHY)

Led by legendary Chinese dissident poet Hao Lin
Ngai, Harmonious Anarchy broke from the Fa Jing
cartel during the tumultuous years prior to the Fall.
Hao sought to create a society in the spirit of the
ancient Taoist state of Great Perfection that existed
in Szechuan 1,700 years earlier—with considerable
updates from modern thought. Harmonious Anarchy
is an Extropian mutualist society heavily involved
in software engineering, logistics, and relocation of
metallic asteroids to the outer system. Most of Mimas
is a very low-g beehive arranged into Black, Red,
Yellow, Green, and White neighborhoods, based on the
five classical directions of Chinese mythology. Each
color boasts an ornate central cavern, with extended
families living in radiating subwarrens. While adhering
to mutalist economic principles, Harmonious Anarchy
simultaneously takes a traditional Chinese approach
to social organization, with family at its core.

### NORSE, INUIT, AND GALLIC MOONLETS

In addition to the classical satellites described here,
three groups of small objects unknown to early astronomers
orbit the planet. These moonlets are designated
as the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse groups. Because these
moonlets were still little explored by the time of the
Fall, most of them remain sparsely populated. With a
few exceptions, inhabitants of the moonlets are generally
people who want to be left alone. The exceptions
are Skathi and Abramsen (formerly S/2007 S 2), which,
along with Phoebe, were captured and moved into
Titan’s orbit, where they serve as defense installations.

### PAN (IZULU)

Volkograad’s closest competitor is this anarcho-capitalist
outfit most of whose founders were South
African. iZulu has a somewhat lower capacity than
Volkograad but will ship reactor mass to unusual locations
like the Trojans and the Kuiper Belt. iZulu is
a very crowded beehive with nearly 400,000 inhabitants
and an unusually large number of infugees. The
nations of sub-Saharan Africa were only starting to
achieve widespread 20th century-levels of prosperity
in the late 21 st , and so they had the lowest capacity to
physically evacuate their citizens during the Fall of any
region on Earth. iZulu and a handful of other habitats
with roots in Africa thus have high infomorph popula-
tions and millions of people in dead storage.


### PHELAN’S RECOURSE

Phelan’s Recourse (usually just called “Phelan’s” by
inhabitants) is the largest nomadic settlement in the
system, with a population estimated around 250,000.
Phelan’s is a swarm of some 10,000 small craft and tin
can habitat modules that orbits Saturn along a highly
elliptical path somewhat inclined to the plane of the
ecliptic. The swarm’s orbit is calculated to maximize
the number of encounters with near moons and stations,
providing a six to eight hour window in which
craft can leave the swarm for trade. Phelan’s Recourse
passes through the rings once a month, allowing craft
to resupply with water and volatiles.

Phelan’s accepts all comers. One could meet just
about anyone here, from the government in exile of
East Timor to hasidim from Brooklyn. The core of the
swarm is the Stills, a fusion-illuminated grain farm and
distillery operated by an allegedly reformed gang of
Irish travelers who conned their way off Earth a few
weeks before the Fall and escaped to the outer system.
The Stills produce Phelan’s Ma, the most sought-after
whiskey in the system, and Phelan’s Da, possibly the
worst beer ever made. Despite the Phelans’ protestations
of legitimacy, the criminal element is heavily
represented here. The swarm represents an important
link in red and gray market supply chains.


### PROMETHEUS (MARSEILLES)

Marseilles (population 80,000) is a beehive habitat
operated by the Titanians. It is rumored to harbor an
antimatter factory, a theory supported by the large
number of skimmers that arrive from the surface relative
to the number of tankers that leave.

### RHEA (KRONOS CLUSTER)

At a 764-kilometer diameter, Rhea is Saturn’s second
largest moon. Composed almost entirely of ice, Rhea’s
surface is sparsely inhabited, but a population of over
800,000 dwells in Kronos Cluster, a major habitat
in orbit. Kronos Cluster’s mass-microfactured violet
spherical modules make it look like an immense, irregular
bunch of grapes suspended in space, an impres-
sion added to by the winding space dock (nicknamed
the Vine) extending from the wider end. Within the
mass of habitat modules, the Vine branches out in all
directions, forming massive central arteries and twisting
side passages. These can be traversed by pushing
off hand- and toeholds on the walls or by catching
grab loops that move along “fast lanes” in the walls
of major floatways.

Nearly five kilometers long and three wide, Kronos
has major problems with crowding and infrastructure
that have kept it from growing to the same size as
Locus. The designers simply did not plan for the
size the place might reach, and as a result another
150,000 people live in suburbs of tin can habs and
scum barges in the space around the habitat.

Kronos can be an extremely dangerous place.
Insurance companies don’t like operating here, and
the habitat is a patchwork of criminal and anarchist
neighborhoods. Anarchist zones are generally heavily
armed and safe, but a trip from an anarchist holding
to the spaceport is best done with a group of well-armed
friends. Criminal neighborhoods are only safe
if you’re in the neighborhood’s controlling gang, and
even then conflicts flare up regular.

The situation is exacerbated by the Kronos Port
Authority, a junta of ultimates who operate security
for the spaceport. Originally an Extropian hypercorp,
the KPA fell into the hands of the ultimates when
they decided that they could profit more directly by
owning the company outright than by working as
hired muscle. They violently ousted the original
management and now use indentures in worker pods to
maintain the port. This situation is tolerated by the
local crime bosses and loathed by the mostly anarchist
citizens, but so far no one is able to challenge the KPA,
which enforces use of the port rather than any other
mooring point with killsats and artillery.

### TETHYS (GODWINHEAD)

Composed almost entirely of ice, Tethys is one of
Saturn’s larger moons and the site of Ithaca Chasma, a
2,000-kilometer long valley covering three-quarters of
Tethys’s circumference. Fifteen years ago, prospectors
from an ethnically Indo-British autonomist collective
called the Rioters touched down on Godwin Head,
a projection in the chasm wall so named because it
resembles a headland projecting out into the sea.
Instruments on their ship, the Caleb Williams, had
detected what looked like mineral deposits in the ice,
rare on Tethys. What they found instead were relics
thrust to the surface by a geological event eons earlier,
the remains of primordial life that became extinct
millions of years ago when Tethys cooled and its subsurface
ocean froze over.

Godwinhead is now a dense, efficient settlement
of 200,000 built into the five kilometer high
canyon walls. The central point of the town is the
Caleb Williams, which has been towed back into a
sheltering cavern in the wall and converted into a
communal workshop and town hall. The face of the
valley wall is honeycombed with excavated ice caves
hosting habitat modules, connected by conduits to
a communal utility grid. The trusswork and cabling
for the utility system is also the public transit system,
easily traversed in the minute Tethyan gravity. The
unofficial mascot of Godwinhead is the Tethyan
Flatworm, a two millimeter-long translucent worm
that represented the pinnacle of Tethyan evolution.
A large number of the inhabitants are involved in
biosciences, xenopaleontology, and prospecting for
frozen lifeforms.

Tethys shares its orbit with its Trojan moons
Telesto and Calypso, both of which are small and
sparsely populated.

## TITAN

Saturn’s largest moon is shrouded in a permanent
orange atmospheric haze, hellishly cold (averaging
180 degrees below), and whipped by winds produced
by tidal forces four times stronger than those influencing
Earth’s climate. On its face, it appears even
less hospitable than the airless balls of ice and rock
comprising every world between Titan and Mars. The
meager sunlight reaching its surface is insufficient to
grow any but the hardiest plants, the mostly nitrogen
atmosphere is dangerously toxic, and the surface is
dotted with lakes and seas of liquid methane. In spite
of all this, abundant hydrocarbons, a thick atmo-
sphere, and diverse chemistry make Titan one of the
few worlds in the system where colonists may rely
entirely on local resources. Titan’s population is now
over 60 million.

Social money and the microcorp system have led
to some spectacular gains and failures. On the upside,
Titan’s civil resleeving industry produces more
morphs than Mars and Luna combined. Massive
infrastructure programs have provided enough space
for 60 million people to live comfortably on a hostile
world. The Large Collider, the biggest particle accelerator
ever produced, in polar orbit, enables physics
experiments that can be performed nowhere else in
the system. And two years ago, Titan dispatched the
first conventional interstellar probe, the Aubade. It
will reach Proxima Centauri in just under 20 years.

On the downside, Titan’s “body for every mind”
law burdens the civic resleeving system with a lot
of people who no one would ever have bothered
resleeving otherwise. The failure of the Scoop project,
an extremely costly attempt to build a pipeline from
Saturn’s surface to low orbit, allowing massive gas
extraction without costly atmospheric skimmer operations,
stymied Titan’s ambitions to become a major
antimatter producer. Titan does produce antimatter,
but on a much smaller scale than was envisioned
when the Scoop project began.

Commonly spoken languages on Titan include
Norsk, Francais, Deutsch, Mandarin, Svenska,
Dansk, and Suomi. Most citizens inhabit hazers, a
tall, fine-boned morph with very similar characteristics
to the Martian ruster. Patagium for gliding and
flying in the light Titanian gravity are a common
biomod. Titanians do three years of compulsory
civil service at the age of majority, with an emphasis
on military and security forces except for conscientious
objecters. Every citizen who has done military
service is part of the militia and has an assault
weapon in their home.

### AARHUS

Located near Titan’s south pole on the shores of
Ontario Lacus, a wide, shallow sea of liquid methane,
Aarhus (population five million) was the first site of
human habitation on Titan, chosen for its proximity to
abundant hydrocarbons. The city is the physical hub of
Titan Autonomous University (TAU) and hosts numerous
other academic institutions, most notably Titan
Tech, a major engineering school. Unlike Martian
universities, which have few physical campus buildings,
TAU and other Titanian schools draw many of their
students from the widely scattered habitats of the outer
system, where delays in radio communication make
distance learning ineffective. Fully 20% of Aarhus’s
population are students, many of them offworlders.

Aarhus’s layout is typical of Titanian cities. Three
central domes are surrounded by numerous smaller
structures, including lesser domes, fusion plants, and
industrial outbuildings, the most massive of which is
the now-abandoned methane utility plant on the lake
shore. The dome interiors are hung with lighting rods
and heavily built up with tall, narrow buildings, most
of which have upper decks where hazers on the wing
and pedal-powered microlights can land. Exterior
structures usually have outer walls built of ice for
shielding and structural support with internal walls
extruded from local silicates. Many buildings are a
rich azure or other shades of blue for contrast with
the ever-present orange glow of the Titanian sky.

Unlike most Titanian cities, Aarhus relies primarily
on fusion power. Aarhus is the center of Titan’s native
preservationist movement, which opposes inefficien
use of native hydrocarbon resources due to possible
long term effects on Titan’s climate.

### NEW QUEBEC

New Quebec lies on a plain in the Aaru region surrounded
by endless rippling dunes shaped by Titan’s
powerful winds. The region’s diverse chemical resources
supply the colossal nurseries that have made New
Quebec the system’s largest single producer of morphs.

The city is 50 kilometers from Montmorency Lacus,
a 20 kilometer-wide crater lake of liquid ethane and
methane. Originally thought to be an impact crater,
rare on Titan, geological studies later showed it to
be the collapsed remains of an extinct cryovolcano.
Situated in a rainy area, the lacus slowly drains over
the crater lip at Montmorency Cascade, a 200-meter
carbonfall that empties into a series of alluvial channels
from which the Quebecoise pump its output for fuel.

The St. Catherine Tong, the most dangerous native
Titanian mob, is based in New Quebec. Titanian law
is generally very permissive regarding individual freedoms,
so the vices this gang trades in are of the blackest:
snuff pods, stolen alpha forks, and nanoweaponry.
A ready supply of fresh morphs bought from corrupt
microcorp nursery administrators further fuels their
rackets. The Tong is extremely violent and a major
embarrassment to Commonwealth security forces.


### NYHAVN

Set near the equator
amid the rolling ice
hills of the Xanadu region,
Nyhavn (population 12 million)
is the largest city in the outer
system and the capital of the Titanian
Commonwealth. Nyhavn’s massive
central dome, with its elegant blue towers
and bioengineered parklands, rivals New
Shanghai in size and ambition. Three surrounding
domes and a sprawl of subsidiary structures are
connected by high-clearance flyways where ground
vehicles and microlights form a steady stream of traffic
at all hours. At the same time, the squalid blandness
that prevails in the Martian suburbs and outlying
souks is absent; the dwellings and neighborhoods of
the Titanian working class display a riot of color and
design, empowered by public fabricators limited by
none of the enforced scarcity of Martian economics.
For all its idealism, the Plurality is not immune to a
desire to showcase its achievements.

Outside the city is a pipeline leading from the vast
Tyska Lacus, 100 kilometers distant. Commonwealth
Skyport, Titan’s principal spaceport, offers quick
access to Commonwealth Hub, the Titan system’s
long-haul space dock, located in geostationary
orbit above the city. The surrounding countryside
is dotted with smaller settlements connected to
Nyhavn by trains and a well-developed network of
surface roads.

Nyhavn is a major media center, with daily life
closely attentive to the debates and decisions of the
Plurality. At the same time, it is a cosmopolitan place,
where Titan’s microcorp movers rub shoulders with
visiting anarchist traders and (less commonly)
legations from the inner system. There is an active
underworld, despite the efforts of security forces, with
the local St. Catherine Tong engaged in continual
low-intensity warfare with triads from throughout
the system.

### PHOEBE, SKATHI, AND ABRAMSEN

After the conflict at Locus, the Plurality became
embroiled in a hot debate regarding the dangers of
hypercorp adventurism in the outer system. It was
generally felt that the Planetary Consortium hoped to
keep the outer system in a position similar to where
the United States kept Latin America by meddling in
its affairs throughout the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries, and that the only counter to this was a
show of force. Titan’s thick atmospheric haze makes
ground-based space defense systems considerably less
effective than on other worlds, but satellites and space
platforms were too vulnerable to serve as command
and control centers.

The solution was to capture three of Saturn’s small
retrograde moons—Phoebe, Skathi, and Abramsen
(once designated S/2007 S 2, now renamed after a
pioneering Titanian economist). Phoebe is the largest
of the three objects. The other two
were maneuvered into the system’s L4
and L5 points. The calculations required
to relocate these bodies were painstaking
and the energy expenditure tremendous, but all
three now serve as major components of Titan’s
orbital defense grid. Whether the system created
thereby is impregnable has yet to be tested.


## URANUS

Once thought of as gas giants like Saturn and Jupiter,
Uranus and Neptune differ from the larger planets in
that they contain large amounts of water ice, methane,
and ammonia and have rocky cores at their centers.
This region of the system is sparsely populated.
Uranus orbits at a distance 10 AU beyond the orbit
of Saturn, 20 times the distance of the Earth from
the sun.

Uranus, the coldest planet in the solar system, is a
blue-green sphere of ice and gas. Seen from afar, it is
virtually featureless compared to Saturn and Jupiter,
but up close subtle cloud formations and a tenuous
ring system may be observed. Probably due to a colli-
sion with an Earth-sized world when the solar system
was young, Uranus rotates on its side, such that one
pole faces the sun for 42 years at a stretch, and its
moons orbit at a sharp angle to the solar ecliptic.

At the time of *Eclipse Phase*, Uranus’s south pole
is experiencing its mid-spring, during which thick
methane clouds darken the polar atmosphere. It
may be the unusual tilt of its axis and the accompanying
strange seasonal weather that give rise to
the unconfirmed rumor that the alien traders called
the Factors have created a settlement hidden in
Uranus’s atmosphere.

### TITANIA AND OBERON

Uranus’s two largest moons are sparsely populated,
with only about 10,000 transhumans living on each
body. Most stations are mixed dome and beehive
settlements and range from hypercorp communications
and research outposts to autonomist freeholds. The
pair are more chemically complex than most moons
in the outer system, consisting of about 30% rock,
20% methane and similar carbonaceous ices, and
50% water. Titania is home to a spectacular canyon
that rivals the Martian Valles Marineris. Several
settlements on Titania cater to tourists from the inner
system and the gas giants, who visit for rocketing,
mekking, and other sports in the canyon.

### CHAT NOIR AND FISSURE GATE

Located on Oberon, this is the Uranian system’s
primary long haul spaceport, with a permanent population
of 8,000. Chat Noir has fairly advanced ego-casting,
resleeving, and manufacturing facilities for a
frontier outpost and is operated by several collectives
of anarchists. The reason for all of the infrastructure
is the Fissure Gate, the only Pandora gate in anarchist
hands (despite several Planetary Consortium expedi-
tions to wrest control of it).

Fissure Gate was discovered by a prospecting expedition
from Chat Noir, then a tiny outpost. Seeking
deposits of the useful carbonaceous ices that make up
about 20% of Oberon’s mass, they instead chanced
upon subsurface radio emissions near the foot of Mt.
Hippolyta. After triangulating the source, the prospectors
landed and used subsurface imaging gear. What
they got back was a blurry image of a rock fissur
containing an ambiguous mass of mixed density and
an extremely dense, possibly metallic object with
a shape too regular to be anything but a structure
or large artifact—all under 500 meters of ages-old
frozen cryovolcanic outflow. The gate at Pandora was
already publicly known at this time, so the prospectors
drilled down, suspecting they’d found an alien
artifact. They were not to be disappointed, although
the discovery yielded gruesome salvage: the barely
recognizable corpses of eleven gatecrashers.

Why and how the Fissure Gate was erected under
the ice remains a complete mystery. At some recent
point, however, it was completely buried, with only
a thin pocket of space between it and the surrounding
ice. When the eleven emerged, buried in an
airless space beneath 500 meters of ice, there was
barely room to move, let alone escape—but the gate
wouldn’t let them back through. Several of the crew
had recoverable cortical stacks. This lucky handful
are now prominent citizens of Chat Noir, but none
plan to resume gatecrashing as a career.

The Fissure Gate remains in anarchist hands, operated
and defended by the Love and Rage Collective.
The gate is made available to almost anyone unless
their rep score is tanked or they are pursuing
commercial interests (ruling out most hypercorps).
Support for gatecrashers is minimal—traverse the
threshold at your own risk. Any discoveries made via
this gate, however, must be shared for the collective
good of transhumanity.

### XIPHOS

One of two major strongholds of the ultimates,
Xiphos is a Hamilton cylinder orbiting in the Uranian
ring system. Though most of the tech underlying
Hamilton cylinders is open source, the station’s frighteningly
efficient weapon systems are not. Rumor has
it the ultimates traded some major favors to Gorgon
Defense Systems in the process of building this station.
Where Aspis, the ultimates’ inner system habitat, is a
relatively open place, used by the ultimates for contact
with potential mercenary clients, Xiphos is off limits
to anyone not of this faction. The rumored population
of ultimates here is only about 10,000, but the
ultimates purchase a large number of infomorph
indentures from Mars. Although there are no reports
of any of these indentures returning, rumor has it that
the ultimates download indentures serving in sensitive
areas into zeroes—deaf, visually limited flats with no
mesh implants and limited mental capacity.

## NEPTUNE

Frigid, swept by 2,100 km/h winds, and tinged blue
by methane traces in its atmosphere, Neptune is the
last major planet in the system, orbiting at a distance
of 30 AU from the sun. This far from the nearest star,
plants will not grow and solar power is useless. The
only sources of power are fusion, focused starlight,
waste heat, and chemical reactions. The hypercorp
presence in the Neptunian system is virtually absent,
as the long communication lags and extreme travel
distances from the rest of the solar system mean that
few Neptunian ventures garner profits Similarly, the
Titanian brand of technosocialism has never found
roots here. The few transhumans who live out here are
a resourceful lot, and many colonists out here aren’t
human at all. Anarchists, brinkers, and desperados
comprise most of the population.



### GLITCH

This habitat has the highest population density in the
system, with 20,000 infomorphs living in a meshed
cluster of twenty spherical structures that are 10
meters in diameter, powered by effici nt central
reactor systems. The habitat is attended by a cloud
of factories, harvesters, and defense satellites that
occupy considerably more space than the station
itself. Various rumors circulate that the inhabitants
are researching methods to improve infomorphs in the
manner of seed AIs, or that they are engaged in some
vast forecasting simulation effort.

### ILMARINEN

Aligned with the argonauts, Ilmarinen is a hybrid
beehive/cluster dug into and partially protruding
from the large L4 asteroid Greymere. It is the largest
habitat in Neptune’s Trojans, with a population of
7,000. Like many transhumans this far out in space,
most of Ilmarinen’s inhabitants are heavily modifie
or inhabit exotic morphs. Vacuum- and cold-tolerant
morphs prevail, and many sections of the habitat are
unlivable for baseline transhumans.


### MAHOGANY

The neo-avians who built this station threw away
the manual on habitat design and revisited the
long-out of favor toroidal configuration The result is a
disc habitat—a plate half a kilometer along the edge
and one kilometer in diameter, resembling a slice
of an O’Neill cylinder with no windows. A fusionpowered,
low-heat, axial light source nourishes
the verdant hardwood forest below. Structures are
built into the disc walls up to 500 meters in height.
The disc, mostly woven from carbon fibe s, rotates
quickly enough to generate 0.5 g at the habitat floo .
Mahogany has a population of 4,000 mercurials,
most of them neo-avians.


### MINOR MOONS

Neptune’s other twelve moons are largely small bodies,
icy and sparsely (if at all) populated. Proteus and
Larissa, both sizable and relatively close to the planet,
host small populations. Naiad and Thalassa are tiny
but very close to the planet and thus home to some
atmospheric skimming operations. Neso, orbiting
at about 1/3rd an AU from Neptune, has never been
visited—even by robotic probes.

### NEPTUNIAN TROJANS

Trailing and preceding Neptune at the L4 and L5
points of its orbit are several hundred asteroids of
diverse, mostly icy composition. Neptune’s Trojans
are home to brinkers, hard-bitten prospectors, exotic
exhumans, and other extreme survivalists.

### TRITON

Neptune’s largest moon has a tenuous atmosphere and
is chemically complex, composed of equal parts rock
and ices (frozen nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxyde).
It is also geologically active, with cryovolcanoes
continually resurfacing the planet. The surface has few
inhabitants but several stations orbit here, using the
moon’s abundant raw materials and low escape velocity
to their advantage.


## THE EDGE OF THE SYSTEM

Beyond Neptune lie only dwarf planets and icy asteroids
waiting to become comets, roughly divided into
two regions: the Kuiper Belt, from 30 to 55 AU from
the Sun, and the Scattered Disk, which extends from
55 AU out to the Oort Cloud. Pluto, its binary object
Charon, and Eris have compositions similar to Triton.
A few small habitats orbit Pluto and Charon, eking
out a living by prospecting for volatiles. A number of
other dwarf planets orbit in the Kuiper belt and the
Disk, including Orcus, Senda, and 2000 OO67. Of
these, only Eris harbors a substantial population.

### ERIS

Located at 55 AU from the sun at the edge of the
Scattered Disk, Eris is the largest dwarf planet in the
system and the site of a grim struggle between two
of transhumanity’s most militant factions: ultimates
and exhumans. The focal point of the struggle is the
Discord Gate, the most remote of the system’s publicly
known Pandora gates, located in an icy labyrinth half
a kilometer beneath the surface of Eris.

The brief history of the gate is bloody. Go-nin
Group troops violently wrested control of the gate
from the Ilmarinen anarchists who discovered it. Titan
and several anarchist and brinker groups both tried
to dislodge Go-nin, but these attempts failed, at great
cost in lives and ships. Go-nin’s control of the gate
seemed ensured until the hypercorp apparently tampered
too heavily with the gate’s black box controls.
A devastating explosion ensued, all but wiping out the
gate and Go-nin base. The gate, however, restructured
itself over the course of several days, though its location
has now shifted to the bottom of a melted crater.

In the short period it took the Go-nin Group to hire a
group of ultimate mercenaries to retake the gate, a hitherto
unknown force of exhumans seized the area. The
ultimates succeeded, but a group of exhumans escaped
through the gate. Go-nin now has nominal control of
the Discord Gate through the ultimates, who maintain
a heavily militarized base on Eris’s moon, Dysnomia.
However, in recent years the gate facility has suffered
several attacks by exhumans eager to infi trate the
gate—and according to rumors, at least one of those
attacks originated from the gate itself.

### MARKOV

The location of this habitat, a major stronghold of
the argonauts, is a closely guarded secret. Attempts
to search it out have revealed only decoys or lifeless
rocks. Though a great deal of information is avail-
able about the habitat’s specs, operations, areas of
research, and informational resources, only highly
placed members of the argonauts may travel here.
By all accounts, the habitat is a windowless beehive,
designed to be virtually emissionless. Speculated loca-
tions include Pluto’s moon Hydra, the deep Kuiper
Belt, and even the Oort Cloud.

## EXTRASOLAR SYSTEMS

Although travel between the stars is still outside the
realm of transhumanity’s achievements, the Pandora
gates have allowed passage to myriad other star
systems. A few are noted here, though many more
exist—not all of them explored.

### ECHO

Echo is a binary system consisting of a bright orange
main sequence star and a pulsar (whence the system’s
name) about 12 light hours from one another. The
system has one immense, bright yellow Jovian world
(Echo VI) weighing in at 1.8 Jupiter masses and
boasting 101 known moons, two Neptune-like ice
giants further out, a thin mid-system asteroid belt, and several
Mercury-like inner planets.

The original Pandora Gate opens onto lifeless Echo V, a forbidding
place littered with the detritus of a dead alien civilization. The
hollow buildings of these precursors look out over once-verdant
alluvial plains now home to only dry arroyos and dust. In other
places, eons of wind erosion have carried the soil away entirely,
leaving only barren expanses of dark basaltic slag. Chemically and
geologically, the world is very similar to Mars, had Mars suffered
another half a billion years’ loss of atmosphere. Research into the
relics of the long-dead aliens suggests that they were morphologically
similar to arthropods or arachnids, earning them the designation
of Iktomi, after a Native American spider god. So far, little else
has been discerned about them.

Echo IV, on the other hand, is the closest thing transhumanity
has found to a paradise since losing Earth. The native life is
carbon-based, with many plants and fish edible even to flats The
climate is warm temperate, the atmosphere breathable with no
major contaminants. The northern and southern latitudes are home
to trackless forests dominated by various species of valders—huge,
maple-like trees with dark red leaves. In the equatorial regions lie
balmy, nutrient-rich floodplains ripe for cultivation, broken up by
the occasional mountain range. Echo IV is still geologically active
due to tidal heating, though older than Earth by about two billions
years, and has two mega-continents connected near the equator
by a tenuous land bridge. Notable native life include the unagi, a
fearsome, eel-like deep sea predator, and the clown sprite, a flyin
primate-analog that exists in a symbiotic relationship with the
Echolalian land anenome, a huge, venomous, carnivorous plant
that grows in the cloud forests of the equatorial highlands. The
biosphere is diverse with many other megafauna, some quite dangerous.

### LUCA

Luca is an M-Class red dwarf located in a region of the galaxy
far removed from any point of reference known to transhuman
astronomy. The system has only a single gas giant of about 1.4
Jupiter masses—insufficient to shield the inner worlds from constant
asteroid bombardment. The lone gas giant is flanked by a tenuous
metallic inner asteroid belt and a wide ice and silicate outer belt.
The only other bodies worthy of planetary status are a hellish inner
world with Mercury’s richness of metal and Venus’s infernal atmosphere
and a few large, sullen plutoids sharing Lagrange orbits with
an asteroid field comprised of the shattered mass of a third plutoid.

Accessible by both the Vulcanoid and Fissure Gates, Luca II
is a heavily cratered terrestrial planet with a thick, dusty
atmosphere—just about breathable to transhumans with the right gear.
It is a cold, rocky world of craggy hills, knee-high forests, hissing
geothermal bogs, and fungal meadows. The natives, who have been
extinct for at least a million years, evolved from animals not unlike
Earth’s aardvarks. Originally insect mound predators, the Lucans
evolved vision well into the infrared (as demonstrated by the
unusual pigments on their pottery and later-stage porcelain) and,
based on analysis of their artifacts, had a sense akin to ultrasonic
imaging. Their civilization went through several cycles of rise and
fall, punctuated by celestial cataclysms that killed off less adaptable
species and made resources scarce. The Lucans seem never to have
evolved past medieval levels of societal organization prior to the
Great Impact. Within a hundred years of that final impact, the last
of the Lucans perished, never having invented the telescope, the
computer, or space flight

Luca II hosts Banshee, an underground settlement
with a few prominent surface features, including a
radio astronomy station, park domes, a short-hop
aerospace port, and solar farms. It is set on the
Howling Plain, a windy plain of scrub brush and bogs
chosen for its rich hydrocarbon deposits and low
incidence of asteroid impacts. Banshee is an uneasy blend
of anarchist colonists and hypercorp interests.

### MISHIPIZHEU

Mishipizheu is a red giant. The planet from which
the star takes its name, Mishipizheu I, is a Mars-sized
sphere of water with an atmosphere of nitrogen and
carbon dioxide and a rocky core. Mishipizheu I was
an almost Venus-sized sphere of ice 700 million years
ago, but the expansion of its star into the red giant
phase melted the planet. Initially quite warm and full
of pockets of ice and carbonaceous silts, the melting
planet was a crucible in which life could develop and
now hosts a complex ecosystem. Amoeboid boiler
reefs composed of gas sac creatures and their symbiotes
bob on the surface or maintain neutral buoyancy
in the depths, becoming platforms for complex ecosystems
of largely animalian life.

Mishipizheu I is orbited by a mid-size rocky
moon, Nanabozho, reachable via the Discord Gate.
Nanabozho is a mystery, as moons of this composition
are not normally found so far out in a system. The
best current theory is that Nanabozho was an inner
system object with an erratic orbit. It was perturbed
out of its orbit by one of the now-engulfed gas giants
that must once have existed, whence by chance it was
captured in Mishipizheu’s orbit. The extraordinarily
slim chances of such an event, however, have led to
wild speculation as to the actual origin of the moon,
which is as popular a destination for gatecrashers as
the planet below.

### SYNERGY

Among the first attempts to establish a gatecrasher
colony beyond the original Pandora Gate, just 5
years after the Fall, was a group of two hundred and
fifty colonists equipped with experimental headware
communications technology. Shortly after the jump,
however, a still unidentified glitch forced the gate
to close and the mechanism could not be reset to
the same setting and coordinates for an entire fiv
years. When the gate technicians finally managed to
reacquire the settings recently and reopen the gate, the
colonists were found to have survived, but they had
changed. The technology sent with them was largely
AI controlled, enabling the creation of a hypermesh
that linked the thoughts, emotions, and sensory
experiences of each colonist with each other. After half a
decade of difficult survival measures, this technology
and the stress of the situation linked the colonists and
their AIs into a group mind. Despite having the opportunity
to return to the solar system, these Synergists,
as they call themselves, have no desire to cut themselves
off from their shared consciousness.

### OTHER EXOPLANETS

The number of extraterrestrial star systems that
transhumanity has visited via the gates now numbers into
the hundreds, if not more—though only a small percentage
of these have been notable and/or hospitable.
Only a few dozen have been substantially occupied
or colonized by transhumans, though this number is
growing rapidly. Among these, a few deserve mention:

#### Arcadia:

Accessed through the Martian Gate, the
Planetary Consortium is constructing an aerostat in
the upper atmosphere of this Venus-like planet which
will serve as a private resort for the hyperelite.

#### Babylon:

Initially thought to just be an unremark-
able scorched moon orbiting a planet very close to
a yellow star, researchers measuring the star made
an incredible accident discovery: what appears to
be a derelict spacecraft orbiting deep in the star’s
corona. Attempts to access this vessel have so far been
thwarted, but other projects are in the works,
including the possibility of towing the craft to safer climes.

#### Bluewood:

One of the first anarchist colonies established
through the Fissure Gate, this settlement inhabits
a beautiful, small Earth-like world with a thriving
ecosystem. Established on the outskirts of a large forest
of eerie, alien, blue “trees,” the colony was taken
off-guard by the trees alarming growth rate. The modular
settlement buildings have all but been surrounded and
encased by overgrowth despite modest efforts to keep
them clear. Still intact but engulfed by spiraling branch-works,
the effect is beautiful and haunting.

#### Nótt: 

This barren ice-covered moon suffers from
heavy geothermal activity that causes its frozen crust to
constantly crack and refreeze. The unfortunate research
station staff here, all indentured, claim that something
out in the ice is stalking them—over a dozen have disappeared
in the last year. Pathfinder refuses to pull the
station back, however, and thorough searches from its
security teams have turned up nothing.

#### Sky Ark:

TerraGenesis is redesigning this dry, arid
moonlet as an offworld preserve for animal life,
including many formerly extinct Earth species
resurrected from fossil DNA.

#### Wormwood:

This maze-like warren seems to be an
actual beehive habitat, though who tunneled it out
or why remains an unanswered mystery. The former
asteroid is part of the ring system of an unknown gas
giant. Clearly artificial gatecrashers so far have found
no signs of technology or life.
