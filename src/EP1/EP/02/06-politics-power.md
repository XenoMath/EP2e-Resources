# POLITICS AND POWER

Politics is just as important in the colonies spread
throughout the solar system as it was back on Earth,
but it is also radically different. Each habitat or cluster
of stations is a separate political entity, and many of
these habitats are fiercely independent. The only locations
where large political entities can exist are on the
marginally habitable worlds of Mars and Titan, and
the population of Titan is significantly smaller than
that of many of the largest pre-Fall cities on Earth

## THE INNER SYSTEM

Though nations no longer exist, they have been
replaced by new political-economic entities that may
well have been on the road to dominance even if the
Fall had not occurred. While there are many independent
habitats and settlements in the inner system, it is
largely under the thumb of the hypercorps. To reduce
conflict between themselves and promote the survival
of transhumanity, some of the hypercorps formed an
alliance known as the Planetary Consortium. This
entity governs most of Mars and is in charge of the
ongoing terraforming project. It also controls dozens
of other habitats throughout the rest of the inner
system (and even a few in the outer system). This
means the Planetary Consortium rules over more than
forty percent of the surviving transhuman population,
making it the dominant power in the solar system. The
other major polities in the inner system, the 
Lunar-Lagrange Alliance and the Morningstar Constellation,
are also heavily influenced by hypercorp interests.

In the aftermath of the Fall, the hypercorps
established three important goals: rebuilding the
solar system, protecting themselves from any further
attacks (either by the TITANs or any other threats),
and growing in both wealth and power. The hypercorps
and the Planetary Consortium are exceedingly
skilled at attaining all of these goals. Since popular
rebellion and widespread dissent complicate these
interests, the hypercorps are also adept at making
certain the inhabitants of the habitats and planetary
settlements they control are safe, relatively content,
and, ideally, unable to cause serious problems.

By extension, the second goal means they also help
protect the surviving transhuman population against
any repeat of the Fall. As the largest and most 
well-organized entities in the solar system, the Planetary
Consortium and other inner-system governments are
in an excellent position to protect the people living
in their habitats and settlements. This protection,
however, comes at the price of freedom. The 
[transitional economies](./08-economy.md#the-transitional-economy)
used in hypercorp-controlled
settlements ensure that most citizens are relatively
well off and need not fear starvation or serious want.
Many hypercorps strongly oppose bioconservatism
(with some exceptions, notably among the 
Lunar-Lagrange Alliance), and so anyone who can afford
various augmentations or morphs is free to obtain
them as long as none are equipped with weaponry
that can be used to harm a habitat or large numbers
of its inhabitants. In return for safety and relative
prosperity, however, citizens give up the ability to
voice more than token criticisms of the hypercorps.

### THE POWER OF THE HYPERCORPS AND THE PLANETARY CONSORTIUM

The Planetary Consortium is the only major non-local
political entity in the solar system (with the possible
exception of the Autonomist Alliance, which is more
of a mutual aid pact than a unified polity). All of the
others are based in a single specific location.

Likewise, the various hypercorps transcend location.
Though some are quite large, rivaling the old
megacorporations of Earth in size, the majority of
hypercorps are small and specialized with few physical
assets, leveraging the capabilities of AIs, infomorphs,
and robotics and communication technologies. Some
maintain staff and work forces large enough to popu-
late multiple habitats, but most rely on few employees,
instead contracting with freelancers or other hypercorps.
Many business projects consist of multiple
hypercorps networked together; temporary and even
ad hoc business alliances are a common affair, with
multiple hypercorps partnering towards common goals.

Thousands of dedicated hypercorp manufacturing
and processing installations can be found on Mercury,
Venus, and other equally resource-rich locations scattered
throughout the solar system. Well-known facilities
include Starware’s vast shipyards, the largest of
which are located on Luna and the asteroid Vesta, and
Omnicor’s huge antimatter factory orbiting Mercury.
There are many other lesser-known facilities, including
the automated mines that the mysterious Zrbny
Group maintains in the Main Belt and Saturn’s rings
and the qubit factory Nimbus maintains in Mars
orbit. Many hypercorps eschew macro-manufacturing
and instead focus on developing new technologies and
new cornucopia machine templates.

Aside from the numerous public hypercorp factories
and labs, there is an impressive number of secure and
often secret research installations, some of which are
so well hidden that they are normally only accessible
via highly secure egocaster connections. All manner
of mysterious and often highly dangerous research
occurs in such locations, ranging from experiments
with the relics of the TITANs to attempts to create
self-replicating nanotechnology or artificial miniature
black holes. Vids and vid games are filled with stories
of exotic disasters in such research stations and of
heroic thieves stealing amazing wonders from them.
While the reality of secret corporate research bases
is normally far more prosaic, sometimes wonders are
created—and there have been occasional disasters,
often involving TITAN artifacts.

Some corporate headquarters are similarly secure
and secret, including the corporate headquarters
of the fabled Zrbny Group. There are a wealth of
rumors and stories about such locations. Intrepid
spies, thieves, and reporters regularly attempt to gain
access to these facilities, generally without success.
Many attempts, especially by would-be thieves and
spies, end with distinctly negative consequences,
including the thieves’ temporary (and on some occasions
permanent) deaths.

Hypercorps also own and manage a number of
habitats. Many are primarily homes for hypercorp
employees, but in others large portions of the population
are ordinary (non-employee) residents. Though
far less controlled than hypercorp research or 
manufacturing facilities, these colonies are also subject
to greater regulation and security than some of the
autonomist-controlled habitats on the edges of the
solar system.

These stations are exceptionally safe places to live.
Residents have access to all of the latest products
produced by the ruling hypercorp (or conglomerate
of smaller hypercorps) and its corporate allies. These
habitats all either possess their own security forces
or have some form of defense contract with a private
security company, such as Direct Action or Medusan
Shield, who agree to protect the inhabitants against
potential threats by agents of the TITANs, fanatical
saboteurs, and other threats.

These same security forces also protect the hypercorps
from any threats to their interests. In most of
these habitats, residents have fairly open freedom
of expression and biological self-determination.
However, all potential threats to the hypercorp and
its personnel, ranging from attempted sabotage to
simple civil disobedience, are dealt with quite harshly,
with serious offences resulting in forced indenture and
occasionally forced mental editing (see 
[*Psychosurgery*](../07/03-psychosurgery.md)). 
Almost all of these habitats use a 
[transitional economy](./08-economy.md#the-transitional-economy)
and most residents have a high standard
of living to compensate for the limits on their
behavior. Many inhabitants of the more independent
colonies in the belt or the outer system complain
about the repressive nature of the hypercorp-controlled
stations, but residents of these habitats prefer
the safety and security found there to the intimidating
freedom of the outer system.

To help reduce dissent, residents of settlements
and habitats controlled by the Planetary Consortium
(and similar hypercorp-dominated polities) can vote
on a wide variety of issues. The results of these votes,
however, are only binding on issues that are not
considered “matters of habitat survival,” “corporate
policy,” or “security concerns,” which effectively
includes anything related to the profits and productivity
of the hypercorps involved. Votes on these
matters are purely advisory, meaning that they are
utterly ignored when the results are at odds with
hypercorp agendas.

While residents of these settlements and habitats can
vote about adding a new holiday to honor some important
figure or the location and design of a new park,
laws regulating indentures, colony security, law enforcement,
or other important concerns remain under the
control of the hypercorps. This does not mean, however,
that the results of elections are completely disregarded.
If more than two-thirds of the population strongly
supports a particular issue, the Consortium or the
hypercorp controlling the habitat usually finds ways to
modify their current policies to address these concerns
without harming their own interests. In contrast, if only
a small number of residents are upset by certain policies,
then these wishes are ignored and corporate security
forces keep an eye out for possible civil disobedience or
other forms of resistance.

Outside of these dedicated installations and wholly
owned habitats, many hypercorps maintain offices and
mesh presences in stations and planetary settlements
belonging to other polities. The larger hypercorps
have offices and branches all over the solar system,
serving the needs of people from Pluto to Mercury
and all places in between, while even smaller outfit
advertise their services via the mesh on any habitat
they can. Almost every habitat has a Nimbus offic
with a farcaster and, in the case of larger colonies, QE
communicator facilities for instantaneous communication.
Both facilities are open to anyone who can pay
Nimbus’s fees. Hypercorps offering ubiquitous services
and products like environmental systems, cloning,
body bank services, banking, spacecraft maintenance
and repair, and so on can be found on most habitats.
In smaller habitats, these offices are unobtrusive, if not
entirely virtual, and managed by limited AIs or indentured
infomorphs. While postings in small habitats are
often rather dull, the infomorph usually has a contract
guaranteeing them a morph and resleeving in the
habitat of their choice in return for a term of service,
which typically ranges from three to five years

Every habitat interested in interacting with the rest
of transhumanity has at least one automated Experia
media node (among other news and entertainment
outlets). Most Experia media nodes are managed by
indentured infomorphs that monitor the local news-finding
AIs and keep track of any important or interesting
developments. Experia and similar news sources
rely heavily on crowdsourced journalism, paying small
amounts for live feeds from any freelancers that happen
to be on-site reporters as important events occur.

Similarly, all but the smallest habitats have office
where individuals can hire security consultants, bodyguards,
or even mercenaries from hypercorps such as
Medusan Shield, Direct Action, or their thousands of
competitors. These contracted security personnel range
from simple AIs and guardian angel bots to highly
trained mercenaries in fully equipped fury morphs.
While additional forces can be farcast in, many of
these security specialists are locals who live on the
station and sometimes hire short-term contractors
to help with especially large or difficult assignments.
Skilled mercenaries may eventually be hired full-time
by larger corps like Medusan Shield or Direct Action,
but since contractors are usually given the most dangerous
and thankless parts of any assignment, many
soon lose interest in hypercorp freelance work.

Other employees working out of local hypercorp
offices range from nanofabrication programmers to
for-hire scientists and technicians to personal financial
and media advisors to the wealthy and powerful.
In important habitats and planetary settlements, as
much as twenty percent of the population consists of
hypercorp employees or private contractors who are
hired on a short-term basis when the local workload
exceeds the capacity of the regular population. These
workers are in the unique position of having dual
loyalties—to both their habitat and their employer.
Despite what hypercorp propaganda preaches, the
two interests do not always overlap.

Because of the delays involved in normal communication,
local heads of hypercorp offices usually have a
great deal of autonomy, since asking for instructions
from their superiors on another habitat or installation
requires either dealing with a time-lag or using expensive
qubits for instant QE communication. As a result
except for the most important or difficult problems,
local directors deal with all local matters on their own,
reporting any unusual or potentially problematic decisions afterwards.

## THE OUTER SYSTEM

Out beyond the orbit of Mars, the influence of the
hypercorps and the Planetary Consortium is far more
limited. With the exception of the rigidly authoritarian
Jovian Republic, the inhabitants of the outer
system have considerably more freedom than those
living in the inner system. However, even out here
the struggle between the desire for freedom and the
longing for safety forms an important part of the
political discourse.

### THE LIBERTARIAN AND UTOPIAN LEGACIES

Various forms of anarchism and similar libertarian
ideologies were quite common among the first transhumans
who settled space in the two decades before
the Fall. Many settlements in the outer system have
inherited this legacy of freedom. The new frontier
opened by space colonization presented a fantastic
opportunity for those with a strong desire to avoid
the authoritarianism of the hypercorp-controlled
inner system and Earth to pursue social organizations
more based in equality and collective action or even
to simply experiment with new political models. Out
beyond the belt, hypercorp influence was weak and
preoccupied, giving resourceful colonists a chance to
explore their interests unmolested. The more radical
of these elements grew out of or maintained ties to
progressive, anti-authoritarian, and left-wing social
movements and insurgencies on Earth, drawing
support where they could. Others simply stole hypercorp
resources from the inner system and smuggled
them to their secret projects. In a few cases, entire
ships or stations mutinied, refusing corporate orders
and pursuing their own path. It was rarely feasible for
the hypercorps to pursue and punish such subversion.

Even among these radicals, differences existed, so
that those adhering to similar sociopolitical tendencies
tended to group together. Over time these have
developed into four rough groupings: the anarchists
of Locus, the technosocialists of Titan, the 
anarcho-capitalists and mutualists of Extropia, and the
nomadic free-for-all societies of the individualist scum.
These factions form a loose alliance, a united front
against the hypercorps and Jovian Republic—or as
they call it, the Jovian Junta—and a pact for mutual
aid and support, known as the Autonomist Alliance.

Among the more anti-capitalist habitats, the centuries-old
doctrine of “from each according to their
ability, to each according to their need” is a living and
vital philosophy. The ready availability of cornucopia
machines ensures that no one wants, and the use of
reputation systems encourages people to be active participants
towards the common good. Equitable access
to morphs and augmentations is also available for residents,
though the demand from so many infomorphs
in need of a body means that infugees must contribute
and build up social capital. However, even for an infomorph,
egocasting across the solar system is expensive,
and the Planetary Consortium produces large amounts
of propaganda about the dangers of these habitats to
discourage infugees from considering escape.

Many autonomists consider themselves to be
engaged in an ideological conflict with the inner
system, a memetic cold war that sometimes extends to
physical actions. Some willingly pursue campaigns of
sabotage and subversion against hypercorp and other
authoritarian interests, such as smuggling cornucopia
machines into habitats where nanofabrication
is strictly regulated, like among the Jovian Republic.
The hypercorps and their allies occasionally strike
back, though open conflict is rare. Even though the
inner system and Jovian Republic could theoretically
field enough military might to subdue the autonomist
factions, an uneasy détente exists. Rumors abound
that the anarchists have some sort of card in their
pocket that keeps their opponents at bay, perhaps
even some threat of mutually assured destruction.

Concerns over security and potential future attacks
by the TITANs also impact matters in the outer system,
but most people resist attempts to seriously restrict their
personal freedoms in any manner not directly related to
maintaining their safety. Inhabitants of the outer system
still remember how the old governments’ demands
of adherence to bioconservativism and allegiance to
distant and often unresponsive leaders did nothing to
prevent the Fall from happening, and that memory
fuels their mistrust of those states. Those powers were
undone by failing to deliver what they promised—when
they could not provide the security that they claimed
their authoritarian measures would bring, the seeds of
their defeat in the outer system were planted.

### SPACE FOR EXPERIMENTATION

Both social and political experimentation are common
in many of the smaller habitats of the outer system.
Because collective decision-making is fairly easy in
stations with populations of less than ten thousand,
direct democracy is a common method of government.
The combination of collective decision-making,
radical ideology, and experimentation has also led to
some habitat populations adopting unusual forms of
government (or non-governmental organization).

The individual variants that have been tried are
too numerous to list, though they generally fit into
a few general categories. A few relatively small habitats
employ limited forms of authoritarianism. Some
have a single leader who has great power, but who is
(ideally) kept from abuse or excess through the use
of limits such as a list of constitutionally guaranteed
rights or the ability of a relatively small number of
people to call an election or a vote of confi ence.
Some colonies using this model have elected dictators
who serve for a limited term, while others are ruled
by a single charismatic leader who transforms their
habitat into a cult of personality.

Other habitats choose their leaders by random lot,
with every adult who can pass a relatively easy competency
test being eligible to be the colony’s leader
for a period that usually ranges from six months to
five years. A few habitats are governed by powerful
specialized AIs, which in very few cases are actually
hyper-intelligent AGIs. Several colonies populated
by purely informorph or synthmorph inhabitants
use special high-bandwidth connections to give their
members access to each other’s surface thoughts
and emotional reactions, allowing them to hold vast
democratic political meetings where everyone present
can feel the general emotional reactions of all of the
other members as easily as they can feel their own.

There are a vast number of different types of government,
many of which have never existed before,
moving (and sometimes fumbling) ahead in the outer
system. Some work far better than others, allowing
successful colonies to thrive and making much of the
outer system a vast and complex political laboratory.
