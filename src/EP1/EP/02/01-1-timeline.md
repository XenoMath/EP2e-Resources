# ECLIPSE PHASE TIMELINE

All dates are given in reference to the Fall.
BF = Before the Fall. AF = After the Fall.
(e.g., BF 10 = 10 years before the Fall.)

## BF 60+
- Crisis grips the globe in the form of
    drastic climate changes, energy 
    shortages, and geopolitical instability.
- Initial space expansion creates stations
    at the Lagrange Points, Luna, and
    Mars, with robotic exploration of the
    entire system.
- Construction begins on a space elevator.
- Medical advances improve health and
    organ repair. The rich pursue gene-fixing
    and transgenic pets.
- Computer intelligence capabilities
    equal and exceed that of the human
    brain. True AI not yet developed.
- Robotics become widespread and start
    to replace/invalidate many jobs.
- Modern nations expand their 
    high-speed wireless networks.

## BF 60–40
- Efforts to undertake mega-scale 
    geo-engineering on Earth cause as many
    problems as they fix.
- Major colonies established on Luna
    and Mars; outposts established near
    Mercury, Venus, and the Belt. Explorers
    reach Pluto.
- First space elevator on Earth finished. Two
    others in progress. Space traffic booms.
- Mass driver built on Luna.
- Terraforming of Mars begins.
- Fusion power developed and working
    plants established.
- Genetic enhancements, gene therapies
    (for longevity), and cybernetic
    implants become available to the
    wealthy and powerful.
- First non-autonomous AIs are secretly
    developed and quickly put to use in
    research and netwar.
- Experience playback (XP) technology
    developed and put into public use.

## BF 40–20

- Violence and destabilization wrack the
    Earth; some conflicts spread into space.
- Argonauts split from hypercorps, taking
    resources to autonomist habitats.
- Space expansion opens up legal/ethical
    loopholes for tech development
    and allows for increased direct
    human experimentation.
- Human cloning becomes possible and
    available in some areas.
- Development of first transhuman species.
- First dolphins and chimpanzees uplifted
    to sapience.
- Fusion-drive spacecraft enter common
    usage.
- Extended colonization and terraforming
    of Mars continues. Belt and Titan 
    colonized. Stations established throughout
    the system.
- The starving masses volunteer themselves
    for indentured servitude on
    hypercorp space projects.
- Augmented reality becomes widespread.
- Most networks transformed into self-repairing
    mesh networks.
- Personal AI aides become widespread.

## BF 20–0

- Earth continues to suffer, but the pace
    of technology allows for some interesting
    developments.
- Expansion throughout the system, even
    into the Kuiper Belt.
- Transhuman species become widespread.
- Nanotech assemblers become available,
    but are strictly controlled and jealously
    guarded by the elite and powerful.
- Uploading and the digital emulation
    of memory and consciousness made
    possible.
- More species (gorillas, orangutans, octopi,
    ravens, parrots) uplifted to sapience.
- Pods see common usage, amid some
    controversy.

## The Fall

- Simmering tensions on Earth escalate
    into outright hostilities and warfare.
- The TITANs evolve from a high-level
    distributed netwar experiment into
    self-improving seed AIs. For the first
    few days, their existence is unsuspected.
    They advance their awareness,
    knowledge, and power exponentially,
    infiltrating the mesh both on Earth and
    around the system.
- Large-scale netwar incursions break out
    between rival states on Earth, sparking
    numerous conflicts. These attacks are
    later blamed on the TITANs.
- Massive netwar ensues and major
    systems crash as TITANs begin open
    attacks and wage war with autonomous
    machines.
- Conflict quickly spirals out of control.
    The use of nuclear, biological,
    chemical, digital, and nanotech
    weapons reported by all sides.
- TITANs engage in mass forced uploading
    of human minds.
- TITAN attacks expand to other parts
    of solar system, heaviest on Luna and
    Mars. Numerous habitats fall.
- TITANs suddenly disappear from
    the solar system, taking millions of
    uploaded minds with them.
- The Earth is left a devastated wasteland,
    a patchwork of radiation hotspots,
    sterile zones, nanoswarm clouds, roaming
    war machines, and other unknown and
    hidden things among the ruins.


## AF 0–10

- A wormhole gateway is discovered on
    Saturn’s moon Pandora, presumably
    left by the TITANs. Four others are later
    found (in the Vulcanoids, on Mars, on a
    moon of Uranus, and in the Kuiper Belt);
    these are collectively referred to as
    “Pandora gates.”
- Expeditions are sent to extrasolar worlds
    via the Pandora gates. Numerous exo-planet
    colonies established
- First contact with the aliens known
    as the Factors shocks the system.
    Claiming to act as ambassadors for
    other alien civilizations, they provide
    little information about life outside
    the solar system and warn transhumans 
    away from both seed AI and the
    Pandora gates.
- An attempt to raise a generation of
    children using force-grown clones
    and time-accelerated VR fails miserably
    when most die or go insane. Dubbed the
    Lost Generation, the survivors are
    viewed with repungance and pity.

## AF 10
- Present day.
