# TRANSHUMANITY

Humanity as a concept has been replaced with
transhumanity. Most people now alive left Earth as
infomorphs and were subsequently resleeved into new
morphs. Bodies are things that can be modified and
replaced, much as someone can alter or exchange a
suit of clothing. Identity is centered in the mind, which
can exist as a disembodied infomorph living in virtual
worlds or dwelling in a vast array of strange and
exotic morphs. While there are bioconservatives who
resist these many changes to identity and physicality,
they are very much in the minority.

To most people, transhumanity has also been
expanded in scope to factor in non-human persons
such as AGIs and uplifts, though the rights and status
of these sapients is sometimes contested.

As transhumans continue to absorb the ramifictions
of this new way of life, they face a new crop
of problems and issues. Two of the largest and most
important are the increase in inequality and the splintering
and separation of transhumanity into many
different clades.

## INEQUALITY

The technologies first developed in the decade before
the Fall and refined in the decade after its end have
transformed humanity. In all but the most backwards,
impoverished, and repressive regions of the solar
system, the vast majority of humanity is smarter,
healthier, and richer than any humans
have ever been. Additionally, individuals
can improve their minds and their bodies
in almost any fashion their imaginations
can dream up. Those who can afford the
right augmentations can think faster, never
forget anything they have ever learned,
become mathematical savants, and heal
from injuries many times faster than an
unmodified human. When resleeving is
combined with implants, transhumans can
gain even more amazing capabilities—but
these benefits are far from free.

During the first decade after the Fall,
most of the surviving population was relatively
poor. Many were grateful to have
any morph at all. While the economic sit-
uation has improved, significant inequalities
remain and seem unlikely to change.
Hundreds of millions of people must
make do with very basic 
[splicers](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#splicers),
[worker pods](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#worker-pods),
[cases](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#case), or
[synths](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#synth),
while a few million are
wealthy enough to have custom-designed
morphs created for them, complete with
all the augmentations they desire. These
same members of the elite live in luxurious
villas and mansions, and in a few
cases privately owned asteroids, while
most other people must make do with
a few hundred cubic meters of dwelling
space. However, while inequities of living
space are ancient, the issue of economic
inequality producing inequities of physical
and mental capacities is both relatively
new and considerably more problematic.

In regions using the [old](./08-economy.md#the-old-economy) and 
[transitional economies](./08-economy.md#the-transitional-economy),
differences between the rich and the poor are
expressed in terms of money. 
In habitats using the 
[new economy](./08-economy.md#the-new-economy),
wealth is meaningless and status and
opportunity are denoted with reputation
scores. In all three economies, some
people have more than others, and
because of this, technology allows the
better off to be better than the people
around them. Skillware lets people buy
knowledge and expertise, while multitasking
and mental speed implants allow
individuals to get more done at once.
Someone fortunate enough to acquire
large numbers of such augmentations
is capable of significantly more than
someone who lacks them, and so can
do even more to increase their money or
rep, thus serving to further perpetuate
inequality. This problem is less serious
in the reputation-based economies
of the outer system, however, as it is
significantly easier to build reputation
through hard work and dedication. In
the rigidly controlled monetary economies
of the inner system and the Jovian
Republic, class stratification is 
institutionalized and upward mobility is largely
a myth.

As supporters of the status quo are
fond of pointing out, even the “have-nots”
are smarter and healthier than any previous
generation of humans and possess the
same potential immortality as the wealthiest
member of the elite. It is equally true,
however, that in many ways the divisions
between wealthy and impoverished are
significantly greater than they have ever
been, especially in the inner system. In
the past, the members of the elite might
be somewhat healthier and better fed
than the have-nots, but both rich and
poor still lived in relatively similar and
fundamentally human bodies. Now, the
very nature of humanity has been called
into question. The least fortunate can be
forced to inhabit bodies designed specifically
for the pleasure of those wealthier
than them or even denied any body and
forced to live as infomorphs until they
can find some way to acquire a new
morph—typically by selling their services
to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, the
well-off can customize their bodies and
their minds, enabling them to accomplish
far more and to be considerably more
impressive and charismatic than anyone
lacking their advantages. These inequalities
may seem insurmountable, but some
anarchistic groups and even some entire
habitats have dedicated themselves to
reducing inequities by producing low
cost (and occasionally highly unreliable)
versions of many of the more impressive
morphs and augmentations.

## CLADES AND SEPARATION

In many habitats, hyper-augmented elites
rule a mass of transhumanity that is
stuck using low-end morphs and minimal
augmentations (or even infomorphs
living in rented morphs), but this is not
the only option found in the solar system.
Transhumanity has splintered into a wide
variety of subcultures, some of which are
based upon an individual’s choice of morph.

Some of this separation is due to the
necessity of inhabiting difficult environments.
Rusters are capable of breathing
the Martian atmosphere while Europa’s
deep seas call for morphs customized
for aquatic conditions. Many unusual
environments require those living in them to choose
from a very limited range of morphs.

There are dozens of specialist morphs designed
for specific uses and environments. A great number
of habitats are inhabited largely or exclusively by
individuals using a single type of morph or a limited
number of specialist morphs. In the asteroid belt and
in the rings and smaller moons of Saturn, there are
more than one hundred habitats that do not rotate.
These zero-g habitats are best inhabited by microgravity-adapted
morphs like bouncers or synthetic shells that
maneuver easily with gas-thrust jets.

Sometimes, though, the separation of people into
clades of similar morphs is ideological in nature, such as
the rise of groups like the 
[ultimates](./10-factions.md#ultimates)
or some of the separatist uplift communities that seek to define 
their own space apart from human cultures. There are many
other habitats segregated into clades for other reasons,
including ones only open to residents with various
enhanced morphs like exalts or mentons. There
are even habitats where all residents must inhabit
morphs that are all clones of one another. In almost
all of these habitats, residents are free to add whatever
augmentations they wish to their morphs, but some
habitats forbid residents from changing their morph’s
external appearance, and individuals who violate this
rule are forced to leave the habitat if they refuse to
reverse these changes.

Some habitats do away with the necessity of both
life support and gravity, with all residents sleeved in
synthetic shells. Others are no more than massive
computers packed in a durable frame, where all of
the inhabitants are infomorphs who spend their existence
in the habitat’s shared simulspaces or their own
personal virtual realities. When they need to interact
with the physical world, these infomorphs are free
to use one of the many synthmorphs that the habitat
owns and that the residents share among themselves.
Although considered quite eccentric to many and horrifying
to bioconservatives, habitats inhabited solely
by synthmorphs or infomorphs are among the least
expensive to build and maintain and are a low-cost
way for groups of infomorph refugees from Earth to
gain independence. Because individuals who choose
this way of life have likely already spent a decade as
infomorphs, this option often seems both familiar
and in many ways more comfortable than inhabiting
a living morph. As Earth becomes more distant in
transhumanity’s collective memory, its traditions and
social norms hold less sway and people feel more free
to create and use new bodies and new ways of life to
go along with them.

## FIRST CONTACT: THE FACTORS

Ironically, the first contact
between transhumanity and
alien life was made by a group
of isolates with no interest in
the rest of transhumanity. A
brinker doomsday cult habitat in
the Neptunian Trojans, patiently
waiting out the prophesized
return of the TITANs, suffered
a severe life support systems
failure. Not expecting anyone to
respond to their distress signals,
they were simultaneously
relieved and shocked to have an
alien starship come to their aid.

Shortly after this event, three
unknown ships of alien design
simultaneously approached
Mars, Luna, and Titan, meshing
with local networks to announce
their presence and peaceful
intentions. Though their arrival
initially raised alarm and panic,
their assurances of non-hostility
and the fact they had rescued
the brinkers allowed cooler
heads to prevail. Coming just
three years after the silent
hostility of the TITANs, the
new aliens were pleasantly
non-threatening.

Quickly dubbed “Factors,”
both because of their claims
to act as ambassadors for an
assortment of alien civilizations and because of their
interesting biology, initial
communications between
pecies were confusing and
jumbled. The Factors made a
number of veiled warnings and
expressed concern over certain
technological developments,
particularly unrestrained artificial intelligence. They have
refused entirely to deal with
digital entities and broken
off negotiations with anyone
currently engaged in AGI
development. They have also
issued stern warnings against
use of the Pandora gates. The
Factors claim they were aware
of and watching humanity for
some time, but chose to wait to
make contact … implying some
implicit fear of the singularity.

The Factors deal commercially
with multiple transhuman factions. Though they are often
dismissive of transhumanity’s technological achievements,
they are interested in our scientific development and break-
throughs, particularly in the
biosciences, as well as our art,
history, and culture. They remain
tight-lipped about their own civilization and other xenomorphs,
though they have on occasion
traded alien artifacts of unusual
design and peculiar function. It
is widely assumed that these are
simply trinkets of limited value
and that the Factors are careful
not to share anything of true
worth to transhumanity, particularly 
anything that might drastically affect our growth.

Biologically, the Factors
appear to be some sort of
evolved slime mold colony. As
far as is known, they communicate purely by chemical signals
and receptors, requiring any
interactions with transhumanity to be computer-mediated.
Several different types of Factors
have been sighted, implying that
they engage in heavy biological
modification.

Factor starcraft appear to
be lighthuggers capable of
near-light speeds. Due to the
frequency of their visitations
to the solar system (2–3 times a
year), however, it is speculated
that they either have a nearby
base or that they possess the
capabilities for faster-than-light
travel—or possibly they have
Pandora gates of their own.

Given the wide dissimilarities
in psychology between transhuman species and the Factors it
would be presumptuous to speculate
concerning their true feelings 
and agenda towards transhumanity. It is hoped, however,
that by continuing negotiations
with them, transhumanity may
learn more about the nature of
the galaxy—and possibly even
our own history.
