# TECHNOLOGY

Technology pervades all aspects of existence in Eclipse
Phase. Most individuals understand that unless transhumanity
suffers another event like the Fall or they
personally suffer some very serious and unfortunate
accident, they are unlikely to permanently die. More
people are now planning for a very long future. For
most people these schemes are fairly minimal, but they
often include an awareness that few, if any, relationships
are likely to last an entire lifetime. However,
functional immortality is only one of the many
wonders of the modern world.

<blockquote>

## OPENING PANDORA’S GATE

The discovery of the first Pandora
gate on Saturn’s moon Pandora
shortly after the Fall was a
watershed moment in transhuman history. The prospects this
discovery raised were simultaneously fascinating and terrifying.
On one hand, technologies far
beyond anything transhumanity was capable of were now in
our hands. This raised visions of
a horizon far beyond the horrors
of the Fall, where transhumanity
could expand across the cosmos,
visiting wonders that were otherwise perpetually far out of reach,
even for near-immortals. On the
other hand, the possibility that
these gates were relics of the
TITANs could not be discounted.
Their existence opened the possibility that the TITANs might one
day return or that transhumanity
might still encounter them out in
the galaxy at large. The alternative was even scarier—that the
gate could be of extraterrestrial
origin and that things more
dangerous and frightening than
the TITANs might stalk the space
between the stars.

Various hypercorps, govern-
ments, and other factions threw
their brightest minds into solving
the mystery of these “worm-
holes.” Numerous scientific
communities pooled 
resources—backed by private sector funds—and
cracked the code of the
Pandora Gate in just over a year.
Not only was the gate activated,
but it could be programmed to
open connections to numerous
distant star systems (one at a
time). Though these controls
were unreliable at 
best—connections sometimes closed without
warning, and others could not be
recalled though they had been
opened before—the functionality
was stable enough to use them in
earnest. At the same time as their
very public announcement concerning
this seminal achievement,
the Gatekeeper Corporation was
formed overnight: a merger of
those same scientific communities
 and their financiers.

Less than a year from its first
operation, the hypercorp opened
the gate to “gatecrashers:”
explorers who risk their lives to
see what lies beyond. Many of
these died horribly; some were
even lost forever, but a few made
fantastic discoveries such as new
worlds and new life. Though none
of the (living) alien life forms
encountered so far have been
sapient, many of the worlds are
habitable or within the possibilities
of terraforming. Along with
these wonders were found more
disturbing things: evidence of a
long-dead alien civilization (the
Iktomi) and signs that the TITANs
had passed these ways before.

Additional gates were soon
discovered throughout the
system. Unlike the spirit of
cooperation that surrounded
the first gate’s discovery, these
others were seized as hotly contested
resources. Initially used for
research and exploitation, many
of these gates are now being
tasked for colonization purposes.
Dozens if not hundreds of exo-planet
stations and colonies have
been established, some with
significant numbers. There has
been no lack of poor or desperate
individuals willing to risk life
on an alien world, if it means an
iota of improvement in their lives.

Though it is now widely accepted that the gates are the
means by which the TITANs evacuated the solar system 
(a hypothesis which fails to answer why
they did so), they appear timeless
in their construction. Regardless
of their origin, the gates remain
one of the most prized and dangerous of technologies.

The five known Pandora gates
within the solar system, their
locations, and their controlling
entities, include:

- **Vulcanoid Gate:** Caldwell (Vulcanoids)—TerraGenesis
- **Martian Gate:** Ma’adim Vallis (Mars)—Pathfinder/Planetary Consortium
- **Pandora Gate:** Pandora (Saturnian system)—Gatekeeper Corp.
- **Fissure Gate:** Oberon (Uranian system)—Love and Rage Collective/Anarchists
- **Discord Gate:** Eris (Kuiper Belt)—Go-nin Group/Ultimates

## LIVING WITH INFOTECH

For anyone with 
[basic mesh inserts](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#basic-mesh-inserts)
or an ecto (meaning about ninety-six percent of the 
population), life is filled with data. For people with the
best implants, all information available on the mesh
is available at a thought. For everyone else, it only
requires a brief pause to access and understand it.
When someone pauses and looks a bit distracted in
the midst of a conversation, everyone understands
they are accessing data and lack the implants to allow
them to do this subconsciously or via multi-tasking.
As a result, when a group of people are discussing a
topic and no one immediately knows an answer to
a question, such as the title of a performer’s first vid,
within a few seconds everyone has this information.
Similarly, when someone walks through a garden,
with a glance and perhaps a brief thought or small
finger motion, they can call up detailed data on each
and every species of plant that sits in front of them.
Individuals going to remote areas that are out of
normal mesh broadcasting range almost always either
carry a farcaster-link or download massive archives
into their implants or ecto so they can continue to
access all the information they might need. Since even
a basic implant can hold vast amounts of data, lack of
storage space is rarely an issue.

Access to such an immense amount of easily available
information has resulted in a variety of cultural
responses. Being able to quote from any vid, old
movie, book, or historical speech is now trivially easy
and can be done with a few seconds of thought. While
children and young teens often play by interjecting
large amounts of semi-appropriate famous quotes in
their speech, most adults only do so for emphasis and
in moderation. People who quote from other sources
too often are considered dull and unimaginative.
Recognizing such quotes is quite easy, since someone
can simply set their muse to alert them to the nature
and identity of all lengthy quotes they hear.

All experienced mesh users also learn (typically as
children and teens) how to avoid taking too much
time out from conversations to check facts or access
information via the mesh. Teens regularly mock their
fellows who pause too often or too long in conversations
to look up further information on a topic
someone mentioned or who spend too long trying
to assemble facts to support an argument. Terms
like “meshed out” or “drooler” are used by teens
to mock each other into learning how to be both
discreet and faster in their information searches, at
least when also interacting with others. While adults
rarely engage in the same sort of direct and obvious
mockery, people who get too lost in casual or 
conversational meshbrowsing are widely viewed as socially
inept. As a result, implants that allow multi-tasking
or temporarily speed up thought are in great demand,
since they allow individuals to do extensive research
and rehearse each statement they are going to make
without a moment’s pause. People who can afford
such accessories tend to seem more suave, charismatic,
and intelligent than those who do not.

All this means that those who lack all mesh and AR
access—individuals known as *zeroes*—present a stark
contrast to the rest of transhumanity. To most people,
zeroes seem slow, forgetful, and almost unbelievably
dense, while to zeroes, even people who only possess
ectos or basic implants seems brilliant, witty, and able
to comprehend things with almost inhuman speed.

## GOING BEYOND THE KNOWN

One of the oddest experiences for gatecrashers and
others who explore unusual environments such as the
ruins of Earth is the unavailability of data. They look
at an alien plant or a TITAN-mutated person, and
their search returns various error messages meaning
that there is either no data at all on the subject or
that the only data is purely speculative and should
be regarded as dangerously unreliable. This can be
especially troubling when the subject in question is
a small creature that has just landed on the person’s
shoulder and the individual wants to know if it’s
harmless or deadly. Most people who are less than
sixty years old have never been in an environment
where they could not gain basic information about
everything around them at a glance. Learning to overcome
the shock of not knowing anything at all about
something is one of the first and most crucial skills all
gatecrashers must learn.

## MUSES

Most individuals have a dedicated AI that serves as
their media agent. Commonly known as a muse, this
AI has been a lifelong companion for most people
less than seventy years old. Muses learn their owners’
tastes, habits, and preferences, and do their best to
make life and technology use as easy as possible.
Muses act as alarm clocks, data retrieval gophers,
appointment schedulers, accountants, and many other
functions often limited only by their owners’ 
imaginations. Some of their tasks do not even need to be
assigned—muses are skilled at learning their owner’s
preferences and acting on them. For example, the
muse’s scheduling function may overhear in conversation
that its user needs to be up in the morning and so
it will set an alarm without any additional instructions.
If a muse is uncertain about its owner’s preferences, it
asks, but after working with a user for a few decades
muses rarely need to do this. Most people keep multiple
backups of their muse, because the loss of a muse
can be almost as traumatic as the death of a loved one.
Using a generic muse who must be informed about
all aspects of a user’s individual preferences and fed a
constant stream of instructions helps people appreciate
the value of their own personal muse agent. Muses
generally learn the basics of a new user’s preferences
in a month or two, but during that learning period the
user tends to be irritable and forgetful, since the tasks
they generally trust their muse to do automatically are
not being taken care of.

## ATTITUDES TOWARD AGIs

The vast majority of transhumanity blames the Fall
on rogue seed AIs (self-improving artificial intelligences).
As a result, any AIs that are not crippled or
somehow limited from improving themselves—including
the AGIs (artificial general intelligences) that were
common and growing in number before the Fall—are
completely illegal in many habitats or at least heavily
regulated. The Fall ended only slightly more than a
decade ago, and many transhumans consider AGIs
and the TITANs that murdered their homeworld to
be one and the same.

In addition to strict anti-AGI laws, there have been
occasional riots and mass panics surrounding facilities
still performing AGI research, which has pushed most
such research into isolated settlements. Nevertheless,
there are still people passionately devoted to AGIs;
some see them as the next step in posthuman evolution,
others value all sapience, and still others actually
worship them. However, AGI supporters have learned
to keep their opinions private in mixed company, lest
they be branded an agent of the TITANs.

In some spots, mostly in the more anarchistic outer
system, attitudes towards AGIs are more relaxed and
AGIs may even be openly welcomed. These places
recognize that AGIs are not the same threat posed by
seed AIs and it is unfair to punish one for the actions
of the other. Naturally, these places are havens for the
AGIs active in transhuman society, who otherwise
must disguise their true natures.

In the tightly controlled inner system, the hypercorps
and the Planetary Consortium foster anti-AGI
sentiments both as safety measures and as protection
against possible competitors. This latter point is one
of the things that makes them attractive to some
people in the outer system; they understand the great
advantages their factions gain … assuming, that is,
that those AGIs share their goals and ideals.

## ATTITUDES TOWARDS MENTAL ALTERATIONS

In the post-Fall solar system, technology can alter
people’s minds; controversy about many of these
alterations remains. Few people have trouble with
the idea of creating short-term forks using the 
multi-tasking augmentation or some similar process that
insures the forks will be re-integrated within a few
hours. However, the idea of long-term forks, and 
especially of allowing forks to gain access to their own
separate morphs, troubles many people. Since there
are not enough morphs to go around in the first place,
providing morphs to a fork strikes many people as
selfish and wasteful. On the rare occasion that people
sleeve one of their forks, they typically provide it with
a synthmorph to avoid the social stigma associated
with using more than one body at a time.

Forks that exist for more than a few hours inspire
discomfort in many people because the forks begin to
diverge slightly in personality. Most people find the
idea of two different and distinct versions of themselves
to be somewhat disturbing. While there are
habitats (mostly in the outer system) where forking is
a regular part of daily life and forks often exist 
independently for a day or two, most visitors find such
habitats distasteful and bizarre.

However, while voluntary forking is still regarded as
somewhat odd, involuntary uses of this and the associated
mental technologies are so horrifying that they
form the basis of much lurid crime fiction Someone
being unknowingly mind-napped and having an 
involuntary—and often secret—fork created is something
that people regard with abject terror, despite it being
quite rare. Similarly, while mental surgery to correct
psychiatric problems or as punishment for various
serious crimes is frightening and disturbing in its own
right, illegal brain hacking draws horror and disgust
from almost everyone in the solar system. Penalties for
involuntary forking and mind hacking are exceptionally
high. In many habitats, they are among the few
crimes punishable by death (including the destruction
of all backups and forks).

## TRAVEL

Travel between habitats and other transhuman colonies
is both exceedingly easy and fairly costly. 
Long-range egocasting is expensive, as is acquiring a morph
at the destination. Travelers have developed various
ways around this obstacle; for example, if someone
only needs to visit another habitat for a few days and
is visiting primarily to engage in real-time commu-
nication, they often choose to remain an infomorph
for the duration of their visit and to communicate via
AR, thus saving all resleeving expenses. For visitors
who require a morph but will not be staying long,
most habitats offer the option of renting a generic
splicer or synthmorph or, for a slightly higher cost, a
generic exalt morph. Habitats or worlds with unusual
requirements, like Mars, Europa, or the various zero-g
stations offer rusters, bouncers, or other morphs 
modified for specific local conditions. These morphs can be
used for up to a week without difficult , and using one
for up to a month is usually possible with sufficien
negotiation and payment. Meanwhile, the traveler’s
previous morph is kept in medical stasis back in their
home habitat, waiting for their ego to return.

Another technique is morph trading by people from
different habitats who know each other and who are
traveling at the same time. A few people do this with
strangers they meet on the mesh, but vids and other
entertainments are filled with tales of people having
their morphs or their identity stolen. A few of these
horror stories are based on actual accounts. Very few
people are willing to let anyone they do not know and
trust use their body, and many people simply will not
lend out their morph to anyone at all.

Some people, however, are willing, for a fee, to act
as a living “taxi” for a visiting infomorph, carrying
it around with them. In these cases the “ghostriding”
infomorph is not permitted to control their host’s
morph directly and is simply a passenger along for
the ride, issuing directions and communicating with
their transporters electronically.

Travelers who wish to either immigrate to a new
habitat or visit one for several months or longer must
acquire their own morph. Usually, they reduce the cost
of acquiring a new morph by selling their previous
morph to a body bank. Alternately, some individuals
sleeved in expensive custom-designed morphs who are
traveling relatively short distances will rent a generic
shell for several weeks and arrange to have their old
morph shipped to them on a fairly rapid freighter.
Doing this is rarely more than a moderate expense,
which makes it less expensive than the costs of buying
or replacing high-end custom modified morphs

## PRIVACY

Privacy is a prized possession for most inhabitants of
the solar system, but it is so rare that for many people it
might as well be a foreign concept. In the 20th and early
21st century, privacy consisted of two concepts that
are now completely separate—the ability to remain
unnoticed or anonymous and the ability to avoid
unwanted intrusion. The first is largely absent from the
lives of most people in the present day. Anyone who
uploads anything to a non-private portion of the mesh
understands that anyone who wishes to do so can gain
access to it. Likewise, anyone who spends time in a
public place understands that anyone can learn where
they went, what they did, and what they said due to the
ubiquity of meshed, sensor-enabled devices. As a result,
everyone’s public life, both on the mesh and in person,
can be transformed into an easily searchable database.
Almost everyone keeps such a record of their own lives,
commonly known as a *lifelog*. Most people allow their
lifelogs to be public, understanding that anonymity is
now an archaic concept.

While the interiors of private dwellings remain
free from continuous surveillance, almost all habitats
have emergency sensors in every building providing
a full record of events to emergency service workers
and AIs in case of problems such as a dangerous
chemical leak, a sufficiently large fire an explosion,
loss of air pressure, or some other equally dramatic
and potentially dangerous event. Both the events of
the Fall and the fact that almost all of transhumanity
now lives in habitats surrounded by hostile environments
mean that such sensors are standard fare. A few
habitats do not allow emergency sensors in private
dwellings, but most people regard these habitats as
potential death traps. These emergency sensors do not
record anything other than the absence of potential
dangers if they are not triggered by specific events.
This limitation allows individuals privacy within their
own residences—as long as they are certain no one
has planted a secret recording device in their home.
Ultimately, remaining unobserved is a matter of both
care and trust, and everyone understands that most
of the time everything they do will be part of the vast
public record.

In vivid contrast, the freedom to avoid unwanted
intrusion is carefully prized by the inhabitants of the
post-Fall era. Unwanted personal or data intrusion
into someone’s private dwelling or personal electronic
files is a serious crime in most habitats. Also, while
both the mesh and augmented reality are filled with
all manner of AI-mediated adware, most of it has
evolved to be relatively benign and to provide non-
intrusive suggestions about goods, information, and
services that are likely to be of legitimate interest to
the targeted person. An individual’s muse filters out
unwanted advertising. While it is certainly possible to
create advertising that can hack through any muse’s
filters doing so is usually illegal.

Unwanted AR intrusions are similarly limited.
During the early days of AR technology, there were
serious problems with users being overwhelmed with
unrequested and distracting input—as many said, the
mist got very thick indeed, so both law and custom
changed to prevent such invasions. Today, most people
expect to only experience data that they are looking for
or that they might be interested in and that any data
they are not interested in will quickly vanish. Being
surrounded by a large amount of unwanted AR data
is not just annoying and distracting, it is also deeply
frightening, because it means that there is a serious
problem with either the habitat’s mesh or the person’s
electronics—it could even mean that the entire habitat
is under direct attack by infowar weapons.


<blockquote>

## SOLARCHIVE SEARCH: INCAPACITATING INPUTS

During the Fall, the attacking TITANs
used a variety of AR and online intrusions
that interfered with or even incapacitated
their targets. The most basic of
these were deceptive AR illusions made
to convince people that their physical
environment was very different from
what it actually was. This fooled people
into attacking their fellows or simply
instigated mass panic. More advanced
versions targeted the empathic elements
of AR, triggering fear or other
emotional responses. Still others blasted
their targets with overbearing sensory
input, so strong that it bypassed filters
and inflicted neurological damage

Despite rumors and fears of so-called 
"basilisk hacks"—visual or other sensory-input 
attacks that allegedly subverted transhuman minds by
exploiting the way brains processed
such data—no credible reports have
been verified.

</blockquote>

## LOW-TECH EXISTENCE

More than ninety-five percent of transhumanity
inhabits artificially created morphs. Most of them also
possess basic implants, and the vast majority of the
rest wear ectos with retina displays and other simple
peripherals that allow the user to fully perceive and
interact with the vast network of information around
them. However, slightly less than four percent of the
remaining population inhabit flats or splicer morphs
without basic implants and also lack access to ectos
and other basic technologies.

Since an ecto is both a relatively trivial expense and
a piece of equipment vital to existence in the solar
system, the only individuals who lack such technologies
stand on the very lowest rungs of the social ladder.
A few are the poorest members of the most marginal
habitats, but most are slaves or the next best thing.
The lowest social classes in the Jovian Republic lack
personal infotech access, as do people indentured to
the hypercorps and the Planetary Consortium, particularly
on Luna and Mars. These individuals are either
indentured criminals or people sufficiently lacking in
useful skills that they are assigned mindless physical
tasks that cannot be more efficiently performed by AIs.

The lack of mesh access makes these unfortunate
“zeroes” into mental and social cripples, unable to
perceive the vast wealth of AR that most people take for
granted. They are also unable to communicate with
anyone beyond the range of their voice or to access
almost all information, including traffic signals and
shop displays. When necessary, the managers and
overseers in charge of groups of zeroes allow them
access to handheld meshbrowsers. These devices
resemble the handheld terminals common in the early
21st century and have limited functionality, typically
forbidding communication and restricting mesh
research to carefully filtered topics

Because of their inability to access AR or the mesh,
zeroes are almost completely isolated from everyone
else, meaning they are also unable to organize
effectively or to otherwise cause trouble for the
people who control them. In much of the outer system,
the existence of zeroes is considered one of the greatest
crimes against transhumanity perpetrated by the
Planetary Consortium and the Jovian Republic.

## LIFE, DEATH, AND MORPHS

While death is no longer a certainty for transhumanity,
it remains a possibility. During the decade preceding
the Fall, most of transhumanity was growing used to
the idea that immortality was in their grasp. Then, in
just a few short years, the TITANs wiped out more
than ninety percent of us. Faced with the horror of
so much needless death, efforts to insure the lives of
surviving transhumans became a top priority. Now,
the technology of immortality—uploading, cortical
stacks, and other related wonders—is commonplace.

Today, most of the residents of the solar system
have adjusted to this fact (except for the most extreme
bioconservatives); everyone expects both to live forever
and to have their friends, loved ones, and enemies do
the same. While death is rare, though, it is still possible.
Severe accidents can destroy someone’s cortical stack
as well as their brain, and egos can also be wiped away
in punishment for sufficiently heinous crimes—though
the process of execution is considerably more difficult
than it had been a few decades earlier.

For most people (with the exception of those too
poor to afford a new morph), non-permanent death is
an annoyance equivalent to events that most people in
the late 20th century regarded as moderate misfortunes,
like a bad stomach flu or a broken arm. In almost all
habitats, if anyone is responsible for someone’s temporary
death, either accidentally or on purpose, they are
also responsible for paying for the person’s resleeving
in an identical morph, especially if that person does not
have some form of resleeving insurance. People who
have temporarily died can expect to receive visits from
everyone they are at all close to after their resleeving,
as well as a host of e-cards and perhaps a few gifts
from their acquaintances and colleagues, all expressing
sympathy at their death and welcoming them back to
the world of the physically embodied. Exchanging such
“life gifts” is an accepted part of belonging to many
professions such as emergency service workers, where
members regularly risk temporary death.

Deliberately choosing to change morphs or to 
temporarily become an infomorph is treated differently.
People typically spend at least a day or two between
deciding to change morphs and actually doing so.
During this time, it is considered polite for someone
to inform everyone they know well or work with
about their upcoming resleeving. Along with personal
visits, as well as calls and e-cards detailing the time
of the upcoming event, the person who is resleeving
is expected to include an image of what their new
morph will look like, so people they know will be
able to easily recognize them. However, it is considered
gauche for someone who is upgrading to a better
morph to include details about their new morph.
Within a few days of resleeving, a “resleeving party”
is typically held to introduce everyone they know
to their new morph. Depending upon how well-off,
well-known, and social the individual is, these parties
range from lavish affairs held in hotel ballrooms to
small intimate gatherings in the person’s home.

Permanent death is treated very differently. Because
it is both relatively rare and no longer expected, the
old funerary rituals surrounding death have faded
and new traditions have grown in their place. Since
every death reminds many people of the billions who
permanently died during the Fall, most of the few
funerals that are held honor both the person who just
died as well as the victims of the near-apocalypse.

<blockquote>

## LOST LORE

The accumulated knowledge and media of Earth,
spanning the history of transhuman intelligence,
is a vast and impressive amount. Even before the
Fall, many orbital settlements had acquired complete
records of all previous transhuman lore and
creativity, including copies of every book, painting,
song, film, TV program, console game, newspaper,
and magazine article that had ever been
translated into digital format, as well as backups
of Earth’s entire internet archives. Numerous
destructive programs unleashed during the Fall
corrupted much of this information, however, in
some cases permanently wiping it from existence.

This means that what remains of Earth’s archived
history and data is patchy and incomplete. Much
survives, but some treasures have been lost. In
particular, media from the era of the Fall itself is
particularly hard to come by, given the consistent
attacks the TITANs were making on information
systems. Proprietary data that was withheld from
the public domain behind electronic gates on
Earth is even more likely to have been lost, except
for a few hypercorps that managed to transfer
their Earth-bound data offworld in time.

Retrieving lost data is a lucrative task for scavengers
and archeologists, though looting the
dangerous confines of Earth or derelict habitats
destroyed during the Fall is a risky proposition.

</blockquote>

## ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA

A substantial amount of media survives the Fall of
Earth, and a significant number of modern transhumans
make their living creating new songs, stories,
reports, or other media. All of this is easily and swiftly
accessible through any basic implant, ecto, or (on very
rare occasions) archaic handheld terminal. However,
most of this media is not to the taste of any particular
individual, and vast amounts of it are mediocre. As
a result, most humans keep two layers of evaluation
between them and anything they might consider
exposing themselves to.

The first layer is based on popularity and critical
reviews. Every piece of media has a rating, often
weighted by the opinions of critics with high rep scores
who comment on their virtues and faults. Specialized
AIs also evaluate the responses of consumers, so
individuals can use reviewers they trust or they can seek
out media that is either widely or specifically popular
in their particular demographic and subcultural niche.

The second filter layer is the individual’s muse.
Muses learn their owner’s tastes and moods and
automatically search out and recommend various
sorts of media. Individuals can do everything from
asking their muse to select something they will enjoy
to asking for a something that will challenge their
opinions or looking at all current events news that will
be of interest to them. Muses use their understanding
of their user’s preferences, mixed with ratings and
reviews, to make their decisions. Individuals can even
set their muses to edit the media itself so that it better
fi s with the person’s interests and preferences. In the
most extreme cases, this process can twist and edit
news so that it bears no relation to real events. This
same process is used to make the characters and dialog
in novels and vids more appealing. More commonly,
the muses merely edit out aspects of a news story or
article in which the individual is not interested.

Ratings, reviews, and muses allow individuals
to avoid media overload, but they also reinforce
subcultural barriers. A great many people only seek
out media and news that reinforces their existing
opinions and beliefs. Xenophobic individuals who
distrust all non-humans, from uplifted octopi to the
Factors, regularly view news stories and AR dramas
about evil aliens and devious uplifted animals who
commit heinous crimes. Similarly, individuals who are
only interested in their own habitat have all external
news altered by their muses so that it refers only to
the effects outside events will have on their station.

In a very real sense, individuals from radically
different subcultures and demographics inhabit
completely different worlds. The one force that
works against this separation is the fact that many
people wish to follow the lives and opinions of those
with the highest reputation scores. In many cases, a
large portion of these individual’s high rep scores
comes from their interest in and willingness to interact
with (or at least acknowledge) a wide variety of
different sources of information. As a result, listening
to opinions by a high-rep celebrity can expose
people to information that they might never encoun-
ter otherwise. Also, in many habitats, AIs responsible
for media distribution tag some news as being suf-
ficiently important that it should be immune to filtering
by muses. This tagging is a regular and expected
occurrence in some habitats, while in others it is
reserved for only the most important and potentially
life-saving information. Bypassing muses for any less
important reason in these stations is considered a
gross invasion of privacy or even a crime.

<blockquote>

## METACELEBRITIES

As the culture industry quickly discovered,
biotech and resleeving technology
clashed with the media’s ability to focus
the spotlight on specific icons. When
everyone can be bodysculpted, the
beautiful people need to be more than
glamorous faces. More to the point, the
public’s interest in celebs faltered when
famous people repeatedly changed
their looks and were no longer immediately
recognizable.

One of the ways big entertainment
has responded is to promote
“metacelebrities”—icons based on
characters rather than real people.
Each metacelebrity has their own
(very expensive) unique customized
morph, but the person sleeved within
that morph often changes. The actress
Angelique Stardust, for example, once
existed as a real person, but is now
a character who has been played by
over a dozen people since the original
rose to stardom in AF 3 and promptly
sold off her celebrity character rights
to Experia. Likewise, award-winning
heart-breaker Juan Nguyen is a con-
structed persona based entirely on the
action hero star who died and was lost
during the Fall. Many metacelebrities
are modeled on fictional characters;
notorious bad girl Sun Mi Hee is no
different offscreen than the ass-kicking
villain role that brought her to fame,
never traveling anywhere without her
iconic pair of glowering smart leopards.
Actors taking on a metacelebrity role
often undergo psychosurgery to better
play the part.

Metaceleb personas are strictly
managed and marketed as a media
product to appeal to specific consumer
groups. Though they play an active
role within hyperelite circles, many of
the genuine glitterati view them with
humor at best, disdain at worst—though
some have learned the hard
way not to underestimate or mess with
the small armies of media engineers
behind each metaceleb’s carefully
crafted image.

## POPULAR TYPES OF ENTERTAINMENT

The most popular forms of electronic entertainments
are vids, vid games, VR worlds, XP, and AR games.

### VIDS AND VID GAMES

Vids are high-resolution audiovisual entertainment
that can be augmented with fully immersive sensa-
tions such as smell, touch, and taste from the point
of view of one of the major characters. Viewing them
purely via sight and sound is much like watching an
old 20th-century film except that it’s interactive and
in 3D. In contrast, full sensory viewing is like being
present in the story.

Most modern vids have variable theme and preference
settings enabling viewers to adjust the content of
what they are watching, including the level of violence,
the amount and type of sexuality they prefer, and the
appearances of some or all of the major characters. In
addition, many vids have alternate endings for people
who prefer happy, bittersweet, or grim endings. Two
people watching the same vid could have very different
experiences if they use radically different settings.

Vid games are like vids, except they are much more
flexible In vid games, the viewer not only experiences
the story with the protagonist—they become the protagonist,
shaping the story through their own actions,
similar to sophisticated early 21 st-century console
games. Some games allow the participation of up to a
dozen individuals or link thousands of players via the
mesh, while others are designed for a single player.
The degree of freedom in vid games varies. Some are
almost fully interactive realms similar to VR worlds
with all but a few characters controlled by AIs, while
others are considerably simpler and more limited
with player interaction limited to a few crucial decisions.
The precise dividing line between vids and vid
games is blurry, but together these media remain the
most popular forms of entertainment, with scenarios
set on Earth before the Fall being especially prevalent.

### XP

Experience playback (XP) is a specialized type of
media that consists of the recorded sensory impressions
of a single individual. Almost all of the inhabitants
of the solar system lead relatively quiet and
risk-averse lives and are naturally eager to be able
to vividly experience adventures such as climbing
Olympus Mons, spending a day in one of the most
luxurious and exotic private habitats, going on a 
scavenging mission to Earth, or gatecrashing. There is also
a thriving fringe market in less savory XP, including
records of people committing all manner of violent
or dangerous crimes and XP of actual gun battles
between well-armed criminals and law enforcement
personnel, which often end with the death of the
morph providing the point of view.

Anyone with mesh inserts can create XP of their
experiences, and anyone with an ecto or mesh inserts
can access the sensory recordings. Selling a particularly
exciting XP, such as a record of the first meeting
with the Factors, can bring in a lot of money or rep.
Most XPs consist of both sensory recordings and the
surface thoughts of the individual who made them.
Many people who access XP are only interested in
the sensory recordings and feel that having another
person’s recorded thoughts and emotions in their head
is intrusive and uncomfortable so they filter them out.
However, some hardcore XP aficionados feel that
accessing the full XP, including the recorded thoughts
and emotions, makes the experience more immersive
and real.

A significant minority of XP fans becomes fascinated
with one or two daring people who regularly
sell XP, known as *X-casters*, viewing all of their clips,
including both the experiences and the accompanying
thoughts. Some of these XP fans become more
interested in the person who recorded the clip than
in the individual experiences, and they often come
to believe that they have a special, clear understanding
of this person, to the point where they strongly
identify or even fall in love with them. In addition,
individuals who access XPs from a single person often
enough sometimes begin to mimic various habits and
figures of speech. Particularly popular X-casters are
commonly disturbed when they see tens of thousands
of people imitating one of their more idiosyncratic
expressions or habits.

A few serious fans—known as *Xers* (pronounced
“ex-ers”)—alter their morphs to resemble their favorite
X-caster. Some obsessive Xers actually attempt to
contact and stalk certain X-casters, perhaps hoping
to become part of an actual XP clip. In most habitats
and subcultures, Xers are widely regarded as having
particularly dull and meaningless lives. Hardcore
Xers are often viewed as being insecure and potentially unstable.

### AR GAMES

Augmented reality (AR) games involve players interacting
both with events in the physical world and
augmented reality imagery that recasts the people
and objects the players see. For example, instead of
seeing another player in a splicer morph and ordinary
clothing, a player of an AR game might see a
horrific rotting zombie, a bizarre alien life form, or
a well-armed soldier. These games tend to be locally
focused within a particular habitat or city so players
can interact when they are within physical proximity,
but some games link habitats within the same
cultural region.

The nature and intensity of these games varies
widely. Long-term games might involve people
playing the role of deep cover spies or some other
exciting and unique role for months on end. Players
may pretend to be anything from time travelers
attempting to prevent some horrible disaster to
covert agents attempting to uncover plots by TITAN-infected
people on their habitat who happen to be
camouflaged as snack designers, personal assistants,
and other mundane citizens. During their daily lives,
players exchange messages with each other as well as
with the people running and maintaining the game.
Some of these long-term AR games have gone on for
many years, with the oldest being almost twenty years
old, predating the Fall.

Short-term AR games, on the other hand, last
between several hours and several days. The people
running these typically rent out a hotel or a park
and various public buildings for the duration. These
games are almost always highly dramatic and consist
of everything from the players having to deal with
a massive zombie attack or alien invasion to them
participating in some simulation of an event on Earth,
like the storming of the Bastille during the French
Revolution. While such AR games can be considerably
less detailed than VR worlds or vid games, many
players value the “realism” of being physically present
during the game.

Since participants in AR games take actions in the
real world, including actions that could be disruptive
or even dangerous, designers of AR games take great
care to prevent problems. In some early AR games,
most of which took place more than twenty years
before the Fall, players were occasionally seriously
injured. A few unscrupulous AR game designers used
their scenarios as cover for actual robberies or acts
of terrorism that were abetted by unwitting players
who thought their actions were simply part of a game.
Since that time, law enforcement observation drones
have kept careful track of people playing AR games.
In almost all habitats, people running AR games must
register their games with local law enforcement or
face serious fines

### VR WORLDS

Virtual reality (VR) worlds involve the creation of a
large and highly immersive simulated environment—a
*simulspace*—where the major characters are played
by transhumans and NPCs by AIs. Unlike vids or vid
games, simulspaces are specifically designed for a
large number of participants. VR worlds consist of
everything from duplicates of various eras of Earth
history to elaborate and strange fantasy worlds with
magic, dragons, and similar wonders. All manner of
alien worlds or settings based on oddities like time
travel are also common. As is the case with vids, the
most popular simulspaces are those set on Earth some
time before the Fall.

VR worlds can have from dozens to tens of thousands
of participants. For the best experience, many
users prefer to access simulspaces through hardwired
server connections as they offer better quality and
less disruptions than accessing wirelessly via the
mesh. Since people immersed in virtual reality are cut
off from their bodies and often thrash around, most
users ensconce their morphs in a tank or special couch
for the duration. VR parlors typically offer private
hardwired pods for participants to physically jack in.
Many habitats also have hardwired systems used just
for this purpose, so users can experience VR from the
comfort of their own dwellings.

Due to distance and communication lags between
habitats, even the most popular online simulspaces
run each habitat as a separate realm, limiting interaction
with users in other habitats/realms. The popularity
of VR worlds like Gilded Empire, set in England
in the 1880s, means that someone moving from one
habitat or world to another could continue playing in
the same game, albeit with a new set of players.

One of the other unusual features of VR settings is
that a large number of infomorphs, including many
infomorph refugees, play these games. As a result,
while even most novice players can learn to easily tell
the difference between a character played by an AI
and one played by an actual person, there is no way
to know if the person playing a character has a physical
body or not.

### PHYSICAL ENTERTAINMENT

In addition to a vast array of electronic and 
electronically mediated entertainments, people also still enjoy
a wide variety of physical sports, ranging from soccer
to new sports like low-g air races, where the participants
strap on wings and engage in tests of speed
and acrobatics. The ability to both fix any injury in
a healing vat and to remove a cortical stack from a
dead or dying body and place it in a new morph has
given rise to a new variety of extreme sports. Starting
a decade before the Fall, various individuals realized
that, barring unlikely circumstances, they could not
die unless they wanted to. This set off a brief trend
in extreme sports and even a few wealthy suicide
hobbyists who repeatedly killed off their current
morph in a variety of unusual ways. The Fall and
the permanent death of more than ninety percent of
transhumanity greatly reduced the interest in playing
with death for many years. Killing yourself just to
experience death is considered mildly distasteful
to most, and many believe such actions belittle the
mass deaths of the Fall. Though interest in risking
death in the line of entertainment has been growing,
deliberate suicide remains an eccentric and dubiously
regarded hobby.

In some subcultures, dueling has been a popular
fad for almost a decade. Swords, knives, and pistols
firing single-shot soft lead bullets are all popular
choices, because none of these weapons poses any
threat to a cortical stack and most do not instantly
kill someone hit by them. However, there are other
more exotic options, including aerial duels with
microlights fitted with blades on their wings. On
rare occasions, duels take place in space, with the
participants wearing non-armored vacuum suits.
Certain criminal groups make money with underground
dueling circuits, pitting biomorphs against
robots against uplifts. The seedier circuits engage
in pit fights featuring illegally acquired backups
sleeved into non-sapient animals, often outfitte
with lethal cybernetics. Such creatures are typically
quite mad.

Dangerous non-combative sports are also popular.
The highest levels of competitive rock climbing on
Mars are regularly done with no safety equipment.
There are similar climbing competitions in many
habitats using artificially constructed climbing walls
as well as regular free-running competitions through
almost every city and habitat. Also, there is an entire
class of sports, including both diving and parachuting,
where perfection of form is seen as a far more
important goal than avoiding injury or even death.
As a result, current high dive records for morphs not
specially modified to survive high impacts are held by
individuals who required either time in a healing vat
or resleeving immediately after their successful breaking
of a previous record.
