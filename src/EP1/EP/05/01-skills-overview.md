# SKILLS OVERVIEW

Skills are divided into *aptitudes* and *learned skills*
(see [*Character Skills*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#character-skills)).
Learned skills are built
on and linked to an aptitude. If a character lacks the
specific skill needed in a situation, they may usually
(but not always) default to the linked aptitude. You
may also choose to specialize in certain skills (see
[*Specializations*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#specializations)),
reflecting an enhanced knowledge of a particular aspect of a certain skill.

## CORE SKILLS: APTITUDES

Aptitudes represent inherent skills and abilities acquired
at birth or during the course of growing up. Aptitudes
are sometimes used for tests, but their primary use is
determining the starting point at which learned skills
are developed. Aptitudes determine the starting value
of their linked skills. For example, a character with
Somatics aptitude 10 who wishes to purchase points
in the Freerunning skill (which is linked to Somatics)
would start with a Freerunning rank of 10 and then buy
additionally points in that skill.

Aptitudes are also used when a character doesn’t
posses knowledge of a needed skill (see
[*Defaulting: Untrained Skill Use*](../03/01-the-ultimate-rule.md#defaulting-untrained-skill-use)).
Aptitudes represent the
basic knowledge that a character has acquired regarding
rudimentary use of that skill. They may not have ever
received any formal training with the skill, but they can
still attempt to use it.

Aptitudes range in value from 1 to 30, with 10
being the unaugmented human average and 15 representing
the average of most genetically modifie
transhumans. Since aptitudes represent untrained
ability, they are capped at a maximum rating of 30.

There are seven different aptitudes that all players
possess. These aptitudes are purchased during
[*character creation*](../04/01-character-generation.md),
but depending on the quality of the morph the character
is currently inhabiting, they may find their
[aptitudes capped](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitude-maximums)
or [modified](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#character-morph).

## LEARNED SKILLS

A character’s learned skills represent the acquired
knowledge they carry with them from morph to
morph, knowledge that plays a fundamental role in
helping define the person’s ego. Learned skills encompass
nearly any skill that you might need to use in
*Eclipse Phase*. They range in value from 0 to 99.

All learned skills have a linked aptitude that is
used to calculate their initial value and which is
also defaulted to if the player does not have that
particular skill


### SKILL CATEGORIES

Each learned skill is classified as either an Active skill
or a Knowledge skill. Active skills typically require
physical actions and are used in action scenes within
game play. Knowledge skills are more knowledge-based
and intellectual, representing ideas and facts.
Knowledge skills may play a less dramatic role in
certain action-oriented game play moments, but they
flesh out the character’s background and interests and
are integral to roleplaying interactions. Active and
Knowledge skills are purchased separately during
character creation.

Active skills are further divided into Combat,
Mental, Physical, Psi, Social, Technical, and Vehicle
skills. Certain traits and abilities may apply to specifi
categories.

### FIELD SKILLS

Some learned skills are field skills, meaning that when
this skill is chosen a particular field of emphasis must
also be selected. For example, the skill of Academics
requires the character to specify an academic discipline
in which they are knowledgeable such as Biology,
Chemistry, or Xenosociology. Field skills are written
as “[skill]: [field]; for example: “Art: Painting.” Field
skills can be taken multiple times, choosing a different
area of emphasis each time, reflecting skills in different
fields; that is to say, each field is a separate skill.
Several suggested fields are listed for each field skill,
but gamemasters and players may also cooperate to
create others that fit their games.

Field skills may also have specializations; for example,
Professional: Accounting (Money Laundering).

### PSI SKILLS

Psi refers to the ability to perceive and manipulate
biological minds via psi waves and/or other inexplicable
phenomena. Due to the uniqueness of this
ability, characters that wish to wield psi must acquire
the [*Psi*](../04/03-traits.md#psi) trait. Psi use also requires a number
of specialized skills (Control, Psi Assault, and Sense)
that reflect special training characters acquire to tap
into their psi powers. Psi skills may not be defaulted
on; the only way to use a psi skill is to possess the trait
along with training in that skill. For more details, see
[*Psi*](../07/02-psi.md).

## SPECIALIZATIONS

Any character may opt to specialize in a given skill
(see [*Specializations*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#specializations)).
This specialization reflect increased knowledge in one particular aspect
of the skill. Many of the skills offered below include
sample specializations. Gamemasters and players
are encouraged to develop other specialization ideas
together for their campaigns.

Specialization provides a +10 modifier when using
that skill in a situation appropriate to that specialization
