# APTITUDES

There are 7 aptitudes in Eclipse Phase, described
in [*Aptitudes*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes).
Each character has these aptitudes at a minimum rating of 1.

## APTITUDE-ONLY TESTS

In rare cases, a test may call for using an aptitude
only, rather than a learned skill. This should only
occur when no learned skills are appropriate to the
test. These circumstances are usually noted in the
rules.

Aptitude-only tests must be handled carefully, as
the range of aptitude ratings (1–30) is typically much
smaller than the rating of learned skills (0–99). For
this reason, most aptitude tests should use a target
number equal to the aptitude × 3. In rare cases where
the test is more difficult the gamemaster may simply
use an aptitude × 2, or just the straight aptitude rating.
In some cases, more than one aptitude may be relevant
to the test and so they may be added together to
derive the target number.

What follows are a few examples where an aptitude-only
test might be appropriate. Gamemasters
may call for similar tests in other situations, but
learned skills should be used whenever possible

## APTITUDE COMPARISON: FLATS vs . SPLICERS AND EXALTS

Compared to humans in the early 21 st Century, the average transhuman in the world of Eclipse Phase is faster,
smarter, stronger, and healthier than their unaugmented predecessors. Normal unaugmented humans, called
[Flats](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#flats),
most closely approximate the type of person that was born in our time. The majority of people,
however, inhabit bodies that are known as
[Splicers](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#splicers)
or [Exalts](../04/02-starting-morphs.md#exalts)
(well, those with biological bodies anyway).
Splicers are genefixed to avoid genetic defects and optimized for certain characteristics, while
exalts are tweaked to make them superior across the board: they are more attractive, more athletic, have
greater cognitive capacity, and are more attuned to the world around them than their unaugmented kin.

### BRUTE STRENGTH

Any test that involves simple brute strength can be
handled as an SOM × 3 Test. Use this when smashing
down a door, breaking an item in half, engaging in a
tug-of-war, or lifting and carrying a heavy item.

### CATCHING THROWN OBJECTS

Use REF + (COO × 2) any time you need to catch a
thrown or dropped object, such as catching a baseball,
saving a priceless vase from shattering, or
[throwing back a grenade](../06/06-action-combat-complications.md#throwing-back-grenades).

### COMPOSURE AND RESOLVE

Various game situations may frighten your character,
turn their stomach, horrify them, or rattle them to the
core of their being. Use WIL × 3 to determine if your
character can hold their ground, keep it down, and
pull themselves together.

### ESCAPE ARTIST

If a character wants to slip free of physical bonds
(such as ropes or handcuffs) or otherwise contort
themselves (such as wriggling out from under a collapsed
wall or an overturned vehicle), an Escape Artist
Test may be called for using the character’s COO +
SOM. Apply modifiers appropriate to the difficulty of
the situation. At the gamemaster’s discretion, escaping
from some restraining situations may be considered a
Task Action with an appropriate timeframe.

### HAVING AN IDEA

Sometimes the players miss the obvious or their personal
mindset or biases cause them to misinterpret a
situation or understand events in a way different from
how the actual character would. In cases like this, the
gamemaster can call for an INT × 3 or COG × 3 roll
(whichever is more appropriate) to determine if the
character gets an idea that will help them along. This
test should be used sparingly and only for assessing
the character’s interpretation of obvious and known
facts and details.

### MEMORIZING AND REMEMBERING

Memories are what egos use to maintain continuity
of self from morph to morph, but humans are notorious
for remembering things incorrectly. Whenever
characters attempt to recall a memory or memorize
some piece of information, use COG x 3 to determine
how well they succeed. Note that characters with
eidetic memory ([*Eidetic Memory*](../04/03-traits.md#eidetic-memory-ego-or-morph-trait)
trait, or
[*Eidetic Memory*](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#eidetic-memory)
augmentation) or [*Mnemonic Augmentation*](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#mnemonic-augmentation)
have perfect memory, so no test is required.
