# SPECIAL SKILLS

While the preceding list represents the skills most commonly
used in Eclipse Phase, there may be certain skills called
for in a campaign that are not found in this book. In this case,
the gamemaster may work with the players to create a new
skill to fill this void. This option should be used sparingly to
prevent skill bloat, and all skills are subject to approval by
the gamemaster

If you choose to create a new skill, keep in mind that it needs
to be linked to an existing aptitude and should be a skill that
is available to all characters, not just specific to one characte .
