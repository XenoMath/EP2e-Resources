## NECESSARY SKILLS

While characters will need a mix of skills to
succeed in the varied tasks they encounter in
Eclipse Phase, some skills are crucial for any
character. If a character lacks these, they will
have a difficult time getting by, so it is important
for players and gamemasters to know
these particular skills.

**Fray:** Fray is the primary skill you use to
avoid getting hit in combat. Even if you plan to
avoid combat, being able to get out of the way
when necessary is a handy survival skill to have.

**Networking:** Unless you live in total isolation,
you need a Networking skill—preferably several.
Networking is how you interact with people in
a particular social circle to obtain information,
spread rumors, call in favors, and so on.

**Perception:** Perception Tests get called for
quite often, so if you want your character to
know what’s going on around them, make sure
to get this skill. Investigation and Scrounging
are also good, but Perception is king.

<div class="stat-list">

## ACADEMICS: [FIELD]

- **Type:** Field, Knowledge
- **Linked Aptitude:** COG

- **What it is:**  Academics covers any sort of
specialized non-applied knowledge you can only get
through intensive education. Most theoretical
and applied sciences, social sciences, transhumanities,
etc. are covered by this skill. Most of
the other skills listed in this chapter could also be
taken as an Academics field reflecting a working
theoretical knowledge of the skill—for example,
Academics: Armorer or Academics: Interrogation.

- **When you use it:** Academics is used when a
character wishes to call upon a specific body of
knowledge. For example, Academics: Chemistry
could be used to identify a particular substance,
understand an unusual chemical reaction, or determine
what elements are needed to nanofabricate
something that requires exotic materials. At the
gamemaster’s discretion, some Academics-related
tests might not be defaultable, given that only
someone who has been educated in that subject is
likely to be able to tackle it.

- **Sample Fields:** Archeology, Astrobiology,
Astronomy, Astrophysics, Astrosociology,
Biochemistry, Biology, Botany, Computer Science,
Cryptography, Economics, Engineering, Genetics,
Geology, Linguistics, Mathematics, Memetics,
Nanotechnology, Old Earth History, Physics, Political
Science, Psychology, Sociology, Xeno-archeology,
Xenolinguistics, Zoology
- **Specializations:** As appropriate to the field.

<div class="stat-list">

## ANIMAL HANDLING

- **Type:** Active, Social
- **Linked Aptitude:** SAV

- **What it is:** Skilled animal handlers are able to train
and control a wide variety of natural and transgenic
animals, including partial uplifts. Though many
animal species went extinct during the Fall, a few ark
and zoo habitats keep some species alive, and many
others can be resurrected from genetic samples. Exotic
animals are considered a sign of prestige among the
hypercorp elites, and guard animals are occasionally
used to protect high-security installations. Likewise,
many habitats and settlements employ small armies of
partially uplifted, genetically modified and behavior-controlled
creatures for sanitation or other purposes.
Many new and strange breeds of animal are created
daily to serve a variety of roles.

- **When you use it:** Animal Handling is used whenever
you are trying to manipulate an animal, whether
your intent is to calm it down, keep it from attacking,
intimidate it, acquire its trust, or goad it into attacking.
Your Margin of Success determines how effective
you are at convincing the creature. At the gamemaster’s
discretion, modifiers may be applied to the test.
Likewise, winning an animal over may sometimes
take time and so could be handled as a Task Action
with a timeframe of five minutes or more

- **Specializations:** Per animal species (dogs, horses,
smart rats, etc.)

### TRAINING ANIMALS

Training animals is a time-consuming task requiring
repeated efforts and rewards to reinforce the trained
behavior. Treat this as a Task Action with a timeframe
of one day to one month, depending on the complex-
ity of the action. Apply modifiers to this test based on
the relative intelligence of the animal being trained,
how domestic it is, and the complexity of the task.

Once an animal has been trained, commanding it
is treated as a 
[Simple Success Test](../03/02-types-tests.md#simple-success-tests)
except for unusual or stressful situations, in which case
the trainer receives a +30 modifier on their Animal
Handling Tests when convincing the animal to complete the trained action.

<div class="stat-list">

## ART: [FIELD]

- **Type:** Field, Knowledge
- **Linked Aptitude:** INT

- **What it is:** Art confers the ability to create and evaluate
artistic endeavors. This is a particularly useful
skill in *Eclipse Phase*, especially in the post-scarcity
economies where creativity and vision can be a key
component to a character’s reputation.

- **When you use it:** The Art skill can be used to either
create a new work of art or to duplicate an existing
piece of art in the hopes of passing it off as your
own. The skill can also determine the approximate
value of a piece of art either on the open market, for
monetary exchange systems, or in terms of reputation
for the artist

- **Sample Fields:** Architecture, Criticism, Dance, Drama,
Drawing, Painting, Performance, Sculpture, Simulspace Design,
Singing, Speech, Writing
- **Specializations:** As appropriate to the field

whenever attacking with a blade weapon in
[melee combat](../06/05-combat.md). Blades may also be used for tests
involving maintenance of the weapon, but not for
repairing or modifying the weapon (that would be
Hardware: Armorer skill). This skill is used for blade
weapons implanted in the body at the end of an
appendage (hands, forearms, feet, octomorph arms,
etc.), but the Exotic Melee Weapon skill is used for
blades implanted in other parts of the body.

- **Specializations:** Axes, Implant Blades, Knives, Swords

whenever they want to attack with a blunt weapon
in [melee combat](../06/05-combat.md). The Clubs skill may also be
used for tests involving maintenance of the weapon,
but not for repairing or modifying the weapon (that
would be Hardware: Armorer skill).

- **Specializations:** Batons, Hammers, Staffs

</div>


<div class="stat-list">

## CONTROL

- **Type:** Active, Mental, Psi
- **Linked Aptitude:** WIL (no defaulting)

<div class="stat-list">

## DECEPTION

- **Type:** Active, Social
- **Linked Aptitude:** SAV

- **What it is:** Deception is your ability to act, bluff, con,
fast talk, lie, misrepresent, and pretend. Accomplished
users of deception are able to convince anyone of nearly
anything. This skill does not include using a physical
disguise or passing yourself off as another person (the
Disguise and Impersonate skills cover those areas).

- **When you use it:** Use this skill whenever you want
to deceive someone with words or gestures. A successful
skill test means that you have passed off your
deception convincingly. At the gamemaster’s discretion,
someone who is actively alert for signs of deception
may make an Opposed Test using the Kinesics skill.

- **Specializations:** Acting, Bluffing Fast Talk

</div>


<div class="stat-list">

## DEMOLITIONS

- **Type:** Active, Technical

your appearance so that you look like someone else.
This includes both the use of props (wigs, contacts,
skin pigments) and the altering of subtle physical
characteristics (gait, posture, poise).

- **When you use it:** Use Disguise to fool someone into
thinking you’re someone you’re not. This can be used
to hide your identity or to make yourself look like
someone in particular. When used against someone
who knows your true look or the appearance of
the person you are imitating, this is handled as an
Opposed Test against Perception or Investigation.

- **Specializations:** Cosmetic, Theatrical

tics. It is about moving fast, maneuvering over/under/
around/through obstacles, and placing your body
where it needs to go. Freerunning/parkour is a popular
pastime in habitats where open space is limited.

- **When you use it:** Use Freerunning whenever you
need to overcome an obstacle via movement, such
as hurdling a railing, rolling across the hood of a
car, jumping across a pit, or swinging around a pole.
Freerunning is also used for
[sprinting](../06/04-movement.md#sprinting) and

## HARDWARE: [FIELD]

- **Type:** Field, Active, Technical
- **Linked Aptitude:** 

- **What it is:** This skill encompasses the ability to
build, repair, physically hack, and upgrade equipment
of a specific type

- **When you use it:** Hardware is primarily used to
repair devices, vehicles, habitat systems, or synthetic
morphs. See Building, Repairing, and Modifying below.

- **Sample Fields:** Aerospace (all air and space vehicles),
Armorer (armor and weapons), Electronics (all
computerized devices), Groundcraft, Implants,
Industrial (habitat, factory, and life support
systems), Nautical (watercraft and submarines),
Robotics (synthetic morphs)
- **Specializations:** As appropriate to the field.

### BUILDING

Creating an item from scratch is handled as a Task
Action with a timeframe determined by the gamemas-
ter. The timeframe should be set according to the complexity
of the object and could range from an hour
(constructing a set of shelves) to days (assembling a
robot from spare parts) or even months (building a
house). Numerous factors may apply modifi rs to
the test, such as the use of entoptic blueprints/help
manuals (+20) or poor working conditions (–10
to –30). Tools are also a factor, perhaps making the
job easier (superior tools +10 to +30), more difficul
(poor or inadequate tools, –10 to –30), or even
impossible (lack of required tools).

### REPAIRING

Damaged items may be repaired in a similar manner. See
the rules for
[*Synthmorph and Object Repair*](../06/08-healing-repair.md#synthmorph-and-object-repair).

### MODIFYING

Altering an object’s design and function follows the
same basic rules as build and repair, above. The timeframe
is determined by the gamemaster as appropriate
to the modification

</div>


<div class="stat-list">

## IMPERSONATION

- **Type:** Active, Social
- **Linked Aptitude:** SAV

- **What it is:** Impersonation is the skill of trying to
pass yourself off as someone else in social situations,
including virtual ones. This includes copying mannerisms
and speech patterns and using accumulated
information to convince others that you are that
person. In a universe where appearance is highly variable,
the question of identity is largely one of both
trust and picking up on behavioral quirks and verbal
cues to recognize a given individual.

- **When you use it:** Sometimes it’s fun to pretend
you’re someone else, and sometimes it’s profitabl
or lifesaving. Use this skill whenever you attempt
to convince someone that you are actually someone
else through some sort of social or online interaction.
Forks use this skill when passing themselves
off as their alpha ego. Impersonate is handled as an
Opposed Test against the Kinesics skill.

- **Specializations:** Avatar, Face-to-Face, Verbal

</div>


<div class="stat-list">

## INFILTRATION

- **Type:** Active, Physical
- **Linked Aptitude:** COO

- **What it is:** The art of escaping detection

- **When you use it:** Use Infiltration whenever you
need to physically hide or move with stealth to avoid
someone sensing you, whether you are hiding behind
a tree, sneaking past a guard, or blending into a
crowd. Infiltration can also be used to follow people
(shadowing) without them detecting you. Infiltratio
is an Opposed Test against the Perception of whomever
you are hiding from. The gamemaster may wish
to roll such tests in secret so the player does not know
whether they have succeeded or failed.

- **Specializations:** Blending In, Hiding, Shadowing,
Sneaking

</div>


<div class="stat-list">

## INFOSEC

- **Type:** Active, Technical
- **Linked Aptitude:** COG (no defaulting)

- **What it is:** Infosec is short for “information
security.” It encompasses training in electronic intrusion
and counterintrusion techniques as well as encryption
and decryption.

conscious search for clues or pieces of a puzzle.

- **When you use it:** Use Investigation to draw conclusions
from assorted details. For example, Investigation
could be used to determine the likely sequence of
events at a crime scene, determine a possible social
connection between two people, or deduce how an
enemy made their escape. Investigation is a great way
to provide clues to players, especially when the subject
matter is something their character might know well
but the player does not.

<div class="stat-list">

## KINESICS

- **Type:** Active, Social
- **Linked Aptitude:** SAV

- **What it is:** Kinesics is the art of empathy and non-
vocal communication.

- **When you use it:** Use Kinesics to read body language,
tells, social cues, and other subconscious indicators.
It can also be used to emote more effectively.
Kinesics is used defensively whenever someone is
trying to deceive you; make an Opposed Test against
that person’s Deception or Impersonation skill.

    Though synthetic morphs are also designed to
    emote, reading them is not as easy. Apply a –30 modifier
    when judging a synthetic morph inhabited by a
    character or AGI. Likewise, standard AIs are also difficult
    to read; apply a –60 modifier when judging a
    synthetic morph or pod operated by an AI.

- **Specializations:** Judge Intent, Nonvocal Communication

### JUDGING EMOTIONS AND INTENTIONS

Transhumans are empathic beings and so you can
attempt to gauge the demeanor and/or intent of
someone you are dealing with by rolling a Kinesics
Test. This attempt to read someone is far from exact,
however, and it is easy to misjudge. The gamemaster
should make this test in secret and only allow a hint
if successful—it is not possible to read someone with
absolute certainty. If the person being judged is
intentionally trying to deceive the character, this should be
an Opposed Test against their Deception skill.

### NONVOCAL COMMUNICATION

Experts in Kinesics can effectively communicate
with each other simply by posture, stances, gestures,
demeanors, and looks. Such communication is necessarily
limited in the amount of information it can
convey, but feelings, attitudes, affirmation/negation
and simple concepts may be passed. To effectively
communicate complex concepts, the gamemaster may
require successful Kinesics Tests from both parties,
applying modifiers as appropriate.

Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish
- **Specializations:** As appropriate to the field representing
dialects, technical jargon, and subcultural slang

<blockquote>

### LANGUAGES IN ECLIPSE PHASE

With the Fall of Earth, the languages that
remain most prominent in the solar system are
those that were extensively carried into space
by countries and hypercorps with aggressive
space programs or by the large populations of
poor laborers and infomorph refugees that followed.
No single language dominated the realm
of space expansion, and multilingualism was
common. Many habitats and (sub)cultural groupings
cling to specific languages as a method of
retaining cultural identity. Despite the availability
of instant translation via the mesh, many
people remain versed in two or more languages.

The ten languages with the largest speaking
populations are: Arabic, Cantonese,
English, French, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin,
Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Other languages
that remain strong include Bengali,
Dutch, Farsi, German, Italian, Javanese, Korean,
Polish, Punjabi, Swedish, Tamil, Turkish, Urdu,
Vietnamese, and Wu. Some languages were
effectively lost during the Fall, especially those
in undeveloped regions, as their speaking populations
did not migrate into space pre-Fall and
were not privileged enough to survive in large
numbers as infomorph refugees.
