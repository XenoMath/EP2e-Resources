# USING SKILLS

Whenever a character wants to do something using
a skill, they must succeed at a skill test (see
[*Making Tests*](../03/01-the-ultimate-rule.md#making-tests)).
The difficulty of the action is applied
as a modifie , as are any other extenuating
circumstances that may affect the test (see
[*Difficulty and Modifiers*](../03/01-the-ultimate-rule.md#difficulty-and-modifiers)).
As with other types of tests, all skill
tests are successful when the character rolls less than
or equal to the test’s target number after any modifiers
have been applied. In the case of skill tests, the
target number is the character’s skill rating with that
particular skill. Modifiers representing difficulty and
other factors are applied directly to the target number
(see
[*Difficulty and Modifiers*](../03/01-the-ultimate-rule.md#difficulty-and-modifiers)).
A roll of a 00 is always a success, regardless of modifiers and a result
of 99 is always a failure, again despite any modifier
that may increase a character’s target number over 100.
Standard critical success and failure rules apply to skill
tests (see Criticals: Rolling Doubles, p. 116), so any
time a character rolls a double (i.e. 00, 11, 22, 33, etc.)
they score a critical success or failure.

## DEFAULTING

Sometimes you lack the skill needed in a certain situation.
In these instances, characters may default their
skill test to the linked aptitude. This reflects the fact
that most learned skills are developed from some sort
of baseline physical ability. Even though you may not
know how to do something, you’ve likely seen how
it’s done at some point, have some idea of how to do it,
or can at least take a shot at it. Naturally, you’re not
as good as someone who has training in that skill, but
it still allows you to make an attempt.

Not all skills can be defaulted. Some skills are simply
too complex or obscure or demand special knowledge
or ability for someone to attempt untrained. For
example, brain surgery or most psi skills are simply
beyond anyone who doesn’t have that ability or the
knowledge of what they’re attempting.

### DEFAULTING TO FIELD SKILLS

In some cases, a character may not possess the particular
field skill that a test calls for, but they may be
skilled in another related field For example, a test to
conduct an alien autopsy might call for an Academics:
Astrobiology roll, but a character who doesn’t have
that skill may be allowed to default to Academics:
Biology instead. The gamemaster decides if and when
to allow this, perhaps applying a modifier to the test
based on the difference between fields

### DEFAULTING TO RELATED SKILLS

If the gamemaster allows it, characters may default to
a related skill that also has some relevance to the test
at hand. For example, a character skilled in Kinetic
Weapons might not be trained in the use of a laser,
but they know enough to point at the target and pull
the trigger. Likewise, a character might not be skilled
in Investigation, but the gamemaster could still allow
them to use their Perception skill instead in order to
realize that a body had been moved from the place
where it had been shot. In situations like this, when
the gamemaster allows defaulting to a related skill, a
–30 modifier should be applied to the test.

<blockquote>

#### EXAMPLE

Srit is wandering through a black market souk on
Mars, trying to find a particular piece of sensory
equipment. The gamemaster calls for a Scrounging
Test, but Srit does not have that skill. She could
default to her INT of 22, but instead she asks the
gamemaster if she can default to the related skill
of Perception, which she has at 82. The gamemaster
agrees, and so Srit rolls against a target number
of 52 (82 – 30).

</blockquote>

## COMPLEMENTARY SKILLS

Sometimes more than one skill may apply to a par-
ticular test or knowledge in one area can aid your skill
in another. In this case, the gamemaster may apply a
modifier to the skill test based on the strength of the
complementing skill, as noted on the Complementary
Skill Bonus table.

<blockquote>

#### EXAMPLE

Dav is hoping to persuade a brinker pilot to take him
to an isolated habitat that doesn’t welcome visitors.
To impress upon the pilot that he is a friend of these
fringers, he calls on his knowledge of their particular
cultural practices (Interests: Religious Cults skill at
45). The gamemaster allows this and applies a +20
modifier to Dav’s Persuasion Test

## SKILL RANGES

What is the difference between being a clumsy neophyte
wobbling in zero gravity and being a veteran
gliding effortlessly through space as though you were
dancing? The answer is training and skill. The greater
your skill, the more likely you are to not only succeed
at what you want to do, but succeed well.

Aptitudes in *Eclipse Phase* range from 1 to 30,
while learned skills range from 0 to 99. These
numbers are an abstraction of the range of transhuman
abilities and traits. The Aptitude Range table
provides a breakdown of different aptitude levels and
how they relate to each other. Likewise, the Learned
Skill Ranges table provides an interpretation for the
capabilities at different skill levels.
