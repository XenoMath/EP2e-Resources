# SKILLS

In a setting where physical looks and capabilities are
easily changed at the push of a button, who you are
and what you know is more important than any inborn
ability. Skills represent the knowledge your character
has, the accumulated set of experience, education, and
inherent know-how possessed by each and every sapient
transhuman in *Eclipse Phase*. They are what allow you
to sneak into a hypercorp station, disable the security
systems, hack the mesh hub, and then impersonate security
personnel to make your escape. Your skills represent
the one thing you have no matter what you look like or
where you find yourself. When your characters explore
what they can do, their skills or lack thereof often
determine the margin between success and failure.

Having a well-rounded set of skills is vital to survival
and success in *Eclipse Phase*. The skills below encompass
a wide selection of talents, enough so that each
character can be unique in their abilities and knowledge.
