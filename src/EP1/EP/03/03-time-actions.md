# TIME AND ACTIONS

Though the gamemaster is responsible for managing
the speed at which events unfold, there are times when
it is important to know exactly who is acting when,
especially if some people are acting before or after other
people. In these circumstances, gameplay in *Eclipse Phase*
is broken down into intervals called *Action Turns*.

## ACTION TURNS

Each Action Turn is three seconds long, meaning
there are twenty Action Turns per minute. The order
in which characters act during a turn is determined
by an Initiative Test (see
[*Initiative*](./04-defining-your-character.md#initiative-init)).
Action Turns are further subdivided into *Action Phases*.
Each character’s [*Speed*](./04-defining-your-character.md#speed-spd)
stat determines the amount of actions they can take in a turn,
represented by how many Action Phases they may take.

## TYPES OF ACTIONS

The types of actions a character may take in an
Action Turn are broken down to: *Automatic*, *Quick*,
*Complex*, and *Task* actions.

### AUTOMATIC ACTIONS

Automatic actions are “always on” and require no
effort from the character, assuming they are conscious.

**Examples:** basic perception, certain psi sleights

### QUICK ACTIONS

Quick actions are simple, so they can be done fast and
can be multi-tasked. The gamemaster determines how
many Quick actions a character may take in a turn.

**Examples:** talking, switching a safety, activating an implant, standing up

### COMPLEX ACTIONS

Complex actions require concentration or effort. The
number of Complex actions a character may take per
turn is determined by their [*Speed*](./04-defining-your-character.md#speed-spd) stat.

**Examples:** attacking, shooting, acrobatics, disarming a bomb, detailed examination

### TASK ACTIONS

Task actions are any actions that require
longer than one Action Turn to complete.
Each Task action has a *timeframe*, usually
listed in the task description or otherwise
determined by the gamemaster. The timeframe
determines how long the task takes
to complete, though this may be reduced by
10 percent for every 10 full points of MoS
the character scores on the test 
(see [*Margin of Success/Failure*](./02-types-tests.md#margin-of-successfailure)).
If a character fails on a Task action test roll, they work
on the task for a minimum period equal to
10 percent of the timeframe for each 10 full
points of MoF before realizing it’s a failure.

For Task actions with timeframes of one
day or longer, it is assumed that the character
only works eight hours per day. A character
that works more hours per day may
reduce the time accordingly. Characters
working on Task actions may also interrupt
their work to do something else and
then pick up where they left off, unless the
gamemaster rules that the action requires
continuous and uninterrupted attention.

Similar to [*Taking Extra Time*](./02-types-tests.md#taking-extra-time),
a character may *rush the job* on a Task action,
taking a penalty on the test in order to
decrease the timeframe. The character must
declare they are rushing the job before they
roll the test. For every 10 percent they wish
to reduce the timeframe, they incur a –10
modifier on the test (to a maximum reduction
of 60 percent with a maximum modifier
of –60).
