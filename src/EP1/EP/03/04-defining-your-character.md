# DEFINING YOUR CHARACTER

In order to gauge and quantify what your
character is merely good at and what they
excel in—or what they are clueless about
and suck at—*Eclipse Phase* uses a number
of measurement factors: *stats, skills, traits,*
and *morphs*. Each of these characteristics
is recorded and tracked on your character’s
*Record Sheet* (Maybe Link Here).

## CONCEPT

Your character concept defines who you are
in the *Eclipse Phase* universe. You’re not
just a run-of-the-mill plebeian with a boring
and mundane life, you’re a participant in a
post-apocalyptic transhuman future who
gets caught up in intrigue, terrible danger,
unspeakable horrors, and scrambling for
survival. Much like a character in an adventure,
drama, or horror story, you are a person
to whom interesting things happen—or if
not, you make them happen. This means
your character needs a distinct personality
and sense of identity. At the very least, you
should be able to sum up your character
concept in a single sentence, such as “cantankerous
neotenic renegade archaeologist with
anger management issues” or “thrill-seeking
social animal who is dangerously obsessed
with conspiracy theories and mysteries.” If
it helps, you can always borrow ideas from
characters you’ve seen in movies or books,
modifying them to fit your tastes.

Your character’s concept will likely
be influenced by two important factors:
*background* and *faction*. Your background
denotes the circumstances under which
your character was raised, while your
faction indicates the post-Fall grouping
to which you most recently held ties and
allegiances. Both of these play a role in
[*Character Generation*](../04/01-character-generation.md).

## MOTIVATIONS

The clash of ideologies and memes is a core
component of *Eclipse Phase*, and so every
character has three *motivations*—personal
memes that dominate the character’s interests
and pursuits. These memes may be as abstract
as ideologies the character adheres to or
supports—for example, social anarchism, Islamic
jihad, or bioconservatism—or they may be as
concrete as specific outcomes the character
desires, such as revealing a certain hypercorp’s
corruption, obtaining massive personal
wealth, or winning victories for uplifted rights.
A motivation may also be framed in opposition
to something; for example, anti-capitalism
or anti-pod-citizenship, or staying out
of jail. In essence, these are ideas that motivate
the character to do the things they do.
Motivation is best noted as a term or short
phrase on the character sheet, marked with
a + (in favor of) or – (opposed to). Players
are encouraged to develop their own distinct
motivations for their characters, in cooperation
with the gamemaster. Some examples are
provided in [*Example Motivations*](../04/01-character-generation.md#example-motivations).

In game terms, motivation is used to
help define the character’s personality and
influence their actions for roleplaying purposes.
It also serves to regain
[*Moxie*](#moxie)
points and earn Rez Points (see 
[*Character Advancement*](../04/04-character-advancement.md)).

Motivational goals may be short-term
or long-term, and may in fact change for a
character over time. Short-term goals are
more immediately obtainable objectives
or short-lived interests, and these goals are
likely to change once achieved. Even so, they
should reflect intentions that will take more
than one game session to reach, possibly
covering weeks or months. These short-term
goals may in fact tie directly into the gamemaster’s
current storyline. Examples include conducting a full
analysis of an alien artifact, completing a research
project, or living life as an uplifted dog for a while.
Long-term goals reflect deeply rooted beliefs or tasks
that require major efforts and time (possibly lifelong)
to achieve. For example, finding the lost backup of
a sibling missing since the Fall, overthrowing an
autocratic regime, or making first contact with a new
alien species. For purposes of awarding Moxie or Rez
Points, long-term goals are best broken down into
obtainable chunks. Someone whose goal is to track
down the murderer who killed their parents when they
were a child, for example, can be considered to achieve
that goal every time they discover some evidence that
brings them a little closer to solving the puzzle.

## EGO vs . MORPH

*Eclipse Phase’s* setting dictates that a distinction must
be made between a character’s ego (their ingrained self,
their personality, and inherent traits that perpetuate in
continuity) and their *morph* (their ephemeral physical—and
sometimes virtual—form). A character’s
morph may die while the character’s ego lives on
(assuming appropriate backup measures have been
taken), transplanted into a new morph. Morphs are
expendable, but your character’s ego represents the
ongoing, continuous life path of your character’s mind,
personality, memories, knowledge, and so forth. This
continuity may be interrupted by an unexpected death
(depending on how recent the backup was made), or
by forking (see [*Forking and Merging*](../09/03-forking-merging.md)),
but it represents the totality of
the character’s mental state and experiences.

Some aspects of your character—particularly skills,
along with some stats and traits—belong to your character’s
ego, which means they stay with them throughout
the character’s development. Some stats and traits,
however, are determined by morph, as noted, and so
will change if your character leaves one body and
takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills
and stats, as detailed in the morph description.

It is important that you keep ego- and morph-
derived characteristics straight, especially when
updating your character’s record sheet.


## CHARACTER STATS

Your character’s stats measure several characteristics
that are important to game play: *Initiative*, *Speed*,
*Durability*, *Wound Threshold*, *Lucidity*, *Trauma Threshold*,
and *Moxie*. Some of these stats are inherent
to your character’s ego, others are influenced or
determined by morph.

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

### EGO STATS

<div class="stat-list">

- Initiative
- Lucidity
- Trauma Threshold
- Insanity Rating
- Moxie

</div>

</blockquote>


<blockquote>

### MORPH STATS

<div class="stat-list">

- Speed
- Durability
- Wound Threshold
- Death Rating
- Damage Bonus

</div>


</blockquote>

</blockquote>

### INITIATIVE (INIT)

Your character’s Initiative stat helps determine when
they act in relation to other characters during the Action
Turn (see [*Initiative*](../06/02-initiative.md)). Your Initiative stat is equal
to your character’s Intuition + Reflexes aptitudes (see
[*Aptitudes*](#aptitudes)) divided by 5 (rounded up). Certain
implants and other factors may modify this score.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Lazaro’s Intuition is 15 and his Reflexes score is
20. That means his Initiative is 7 (15 + 20 = 35,
35 ÷ 5 = 7).

</blockquote>

### SPEED (SPD)

The Speed stat determines how often your character
gets to act in an Action Turn (see [*Speed*](../06/02-initiative.md#speed)).
All characters start with a Speed stat of 1, meaning
they act once per turn. Certain implants and other
advantages may boost this up to a maximum of 4.

### DURABILITY (DUR)

Durability is your morph’s physical health (or
structural integrity in the case of synthetic shells, or
system integrity in the case of infomorphs). It determines
the amount of damage your morph can take
before you are incapacitated or killed
(see [*Physical Health*](../06/07-physical-health.md)).

Durability is unlimited, though the range for baseline
(unmodified) humans tends to fall between 20 and 60.
Your Durability stat is determined by your morph.

### WOUND THRESHOLD (WT)

A Wound Threshold is used to determine if you
receive a wound each time you take physical damage
(see [*Physical Health*](../06/07-physical-health.md)).
The higher the Wound Threshold, the more resistant to
serious injury you are.

Wound Threshold is calculated by dividing
Durability by 5 (rounding up).

### DEATH RATING (DR)

Death Rating is the total amount of damage your
morph can take before it is killed or destroyed beyond
repair. Death Rating is equal to DUR × 1.5 for biomorphs
and DUR × 2 for synthmorphs.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Tyska is sleeved in a run-of-the-mill splicer morph
with a Durability of 30. That gives him a Wound
Threshold of 6 (30 ÷ 5) and a Death Rating of
45 (30 × 1.5). If Tyska acquired an implant that
boosted his Durability by +10 to 40, his Wound
Threshold would be 8 (40 ÷ 5) and his Death
Rating would be 60 (40 × 1.5).

</blockquote>

### LUCIDITY (LUC)

Lucidity is similar to Durability, except that it measures
mental health and state of mind rather than physical
well-being. Your Lucidity determines how much stress
(mental damage) you can take before you are incapacitated
or driven insane (see [*Mental Health*](../06/09-mental-health.md)).

Lucidity is unlimited, but generally ranges from
20 to 60 for baseline unmodified humans. Lucidity is
determined by your Willpower aptitude × 2.

### TRAUMA THRESHOLD (TT)

The Trauma Threshold determines if you suffer a
trauma (mental wound) each time you take stress (see
[*Mental Health*](../06/09-mental-health.md)). A higher Trauma Threshold
means that your mental state is more resilient against
experiences that might inflict psychiatric disorders or
other serious mental instabilities.

Trauma Threshold is calculated by dividing Lucidity
by 5 (rounding up).


### INSANITY RATING (IR)

Your Insanity Rating is the total amount of stress your
mind can take before you go permanently insane and
are lost for good. Insanity Rating equals LUC × 2.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Cole’s Willpower is 16. That makes his Lucidity
stat 32 (16 × 2), his Trauma Threshold 7 (32 ÷ 5,
rounded up), and his Insanity Rating 64 (32 × 2)

</blockquote>

### MOXIE

Moxie represents your character’s inherent talent at
facing down challenges and overcoming obstacles
with spirited fervor. More than just luck, Moxie is
your character’s ability to run the edge and do what
it takes, no matter the odds. Some people consider it
the evolutionary trait that spurred humankind to pick
up tools, expand our brains, and face the future head
on, leaving other mammals in the dust. When the sky
is falling, death is imminent, and no one can help you,
Moxie is what saves the day.

The Moxie stat is rated between 1 and 10, as purchased
during character creation (and perhaps raised
later). In game play, Moxie is used to influence the
odds in your favor. Every game session, your character
begins with a number of Moxie points equal to their
Moxie stat. Moxie points may be spent for any of the
following effects:

- The character may ignore all negative modifier
    that apply to a test. The Moxie point must be
    spent *before* dice are rolled.
- The character may flip-flo a d100 roll result. For
    example, an 83 would become a 38.
- The character may upgrade a success, making it
    a critical success, as if they rolled doubles. The
    character must succeed in the test before they
    spend the Moxie point.
- The character may ignore a critical failure, treating
    it as a regular failure instead.
- The character may go first in an [Action Phase](../06/03-actions.md).

Only 1 point of Moxie may be spent on a single roll.
Moxie points will fluctuate during gameplay, as they
are spent and sometimes regained.

**Regaining Moxie:** At the gamemaster’s discretion,
Moxie points may be refreshed up to the character’s
full Moxie stat any time the character rests for a
significant period. Moxie points may also be regained if
the character achieves a personal goal, as determined
by their [*Motivations*](#motivations). The gamemaster
determines how much Moxie is regained in propor-
tion to the goal achieved.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Audrey has a difficult Piloting: Aircraft roll to make.
Her skill is 61, but she’s facing a lot of modifiers
(–30), and if she fails she’s in big trouble. She
could spend a point of Moxie before the test to
ignore the modifiers, but she decides to take
her chances against the target number of 31.
Unfortunately, she rolls an 82. Luckily, she can
spend a Moxie point to flip-flop that roll and make
it a 28—a success!

</blockquote>

### DAMAGE BONUS

The Damage Bonus stat quantifies how much extra
oomph your character is able to give their melee and
thrown weapons attacks. Damage Bonus is determined
by dividing your Somatics aptitude (see [*Aptitudes*](#aptitudes))
by 10 and rounding down.

## CHARACTER SKILLS

Skills represent your character’s talents. Skills are
broken down into *aptitudes* (ingrained abilities that
everyone has) and *learned skills* (abilities and knowledge
picked up over time). Skills determine the target
number used for tests (see
[*Making Tests*](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#making-tests)).


### APTITUDES

Aptitudes are the core skills that every character has
by default. They are the foundation on which learned
skills are built. Aptitudes are purchased during character
creation and rate between 1 and 30, with 10
being average for a baseline unmodified human. They
represent the ingrained characteristics and talents that
your character has developed from birth and stick
with you even when you change morphs—though
some morphs may modify your aptitude ratings.


Each learned skill is linked to an aptitude. If a character
doesn’t have the skill necessary for a test, they
may default to the aptitude instead
(see [*Defaulting: Untrained Skill Use*](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#defaulting-untrained-skill-use)).

There are 7 aptitudes in *Eclipse Phase*:

- **Cognition (COG)** is your aptitude for problemsolving,
    logical analysis, and understanding. It
    also includes memory and recall.
- **Coordination (COO)** is your skill at integrating
    the actions of different parts of your morph
    to produce smooth, successful movements. It
    includes manual dexterity, fine motor control,
    nimbleness, and balance.
- **Intuition (INT)** is your skill at following your
    gut instincts and evaluating on the fly. It includes
    physical awareness, cleverness, and cunning.
- **Reflexes (REF)** is your skill at acting quickly. This
    encompasses your reaction time, your gut-level
    response, and your ability to think fast.
- **Savvy (SAV)** is your mental adaptability, social
    intuition, and proficiency for interacting
    with others. It includes social awareness and
    manipulation.
- **Somatics (SOM)** is your skill at pushing your
    morph to the best of its physical ability, including
    the fundamental utilization of the morph’s strength,
    endurance, and sustained positioning and motion.
- **Willpower (WIL)** is your skill for self-control,
    your ability to command your own destiny.

### LEARNED SKILLS

Learned skills encompass a wide range of specialties
and education, from combat training to negotiating
to astrophysics (see [*Skill List*](../05/04-complete-skill-list.md),
for a complete list). Learned skills range in rating from 1 to 99, with
an average proficiency being 50. Each learned skill is
linked to an aptitude, which represents the underlying
competency in which the skill is based. When a
learned skill is purchased (either during character
generation or advancement), it is bought starting at
the rating of the linked aptitude and then raised from
there. If the linked aptitude is raised or modified, all
skills built off it are modified appropriately as well.

Depending on your background and faction, you
may receive some starting skills for free during
character creation. Like aptitudes, learned skills stay
with the character even when they change morphs,
though certain morphs, implants, and other factors
may sometimes modify your skill rating. If you lack a
particular skill called for by a test, in most cases you
can default to the linked aptitude for the test (see
[*Defaulting: Untrained Skill Use*](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#defaulting-untrained-skill-use)).

### SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations represent an area of concentration and
focus in a particular learned skill. A character who
learns a specialization is one who not only grasps the
basic tenets of that skill, but they have trained hard
to excel in one particular aspect of that skill’s field
Specializations apply a +10 modifier when the character
utilizes that skill in the area of specialization.

Specializations may be purchased during character
creation or advancement for any existing skill
the character possesses with a rating of 30 or more.
Only one specialization may be purchased for each
skill. Specific possible specializations are noted under
individual the skill descriptions (see
[*Complete Skill List*](../05/04-complete-skill-list.md)).

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Toljek has Palming skill of 63 with a specialization
in Pickpocketing. Whenever he uses Palming to
pick someone’s pocket or otherwise steal from
someone’s person, his target number is 73, but for
all other uses of Palming the standard 63 applies

</blockquote>

## CHARACTER TRAITS

Traits include a range of inherent qualities and features
that help define your character. Some traits are
positive, in that they give your character a bonus to
certain stats, skills, or tests, or otherwise give them
an edge in certain situations. Others are negative, in
that they impair your abilities or occasionally create
a glitch in your plans. Some traits apply to a character’s
ego, staying with them from body to body, while
others only apply to a character’s morph.

Traits are purchased during character generation.
Positive traits cost customization points (CP), while
negative traits give you extra CP to spend on other
things (see [*Traits*](../04/03-traits.md)). The maximum number of
CP you may spend on traits is 50, while the maximum
you may gain from negative traits is 50. In rare
circumstances—and only with gamemaster approval—traits
may be purchased, bought off, or inflicted
during gameplay (see
[*Gaining/Losing Traits*](../04/04-character-advancement.md#gaininglosing-traits)).

## CHARACTER MORPH

In *Eclipse Phase*, your body is disposable. If your body
gets old, sick, or too heavily damaged, you can digitize
your consciousness and download it into a new body.
The process isn’t cheap or easy, but it offers effective
immortality—as long as you remember to back yourself up
and don’t go insane. The term *morph* is used to
describe any type of form your mind inhabits, whether
it be a vat-grown clone sleeve, a synthetic robotic shell,
a part-bio/part-flesh pod, or even the purely electronic
software state of an infomorph.

You purchase your starting morph during character
creation (see [*Starting Morphs*](../04/02-starting-morphs.md)). This is likely
the morph you were born with (assuming you were
born), though it may simply be another morph you’ve
moved onto.

Physical looks aside, your morph has a large impact
on your characteristics. Your morph determines certain
physical stats, such as Durability and Wound Threshold,
and it may also influence Initiative and Speed. Morphs
may also modify some of your aptitudes and learned
skills. Some morphs come pre-loaded with specifi
traits and implants, representing how it was crafted,
and you can always bling yourself out with more
implants if you choose (see [*Implants*](./05-things-characters-use.md#implants)).
All of these factors are noted in the individual morph
descriptions (see [*Starting Morphs*](../04/02-starting-morphs.md)).

If you plan on switching your current morph to
another during gameplay, you may first want to back
yourself up (see [*Backups and Uploading*](../09/01-backups-uploading.md)).
Backing up regularly is always a smart option in case
you suffer an accidental or untimely death. Acquiring
a new morph is not always easy, especially if you
want it pre-loaded according to certain specifications
The full process is detailed under [*Resleeving*](../09/02-resleeving.md).

### APTITUDE MAXIMUMS

Every morph has an aptitude maximum, sometimes
modified by traits. This maximum represents the
highest value at which the character may use that
aptitude while inhabiting that morph, reflecting an
inherent limitation in some morphs. If a character’s
aptitude (including any bonuses from that morph)
exceeds the aptitude maximum of their morph, they
must use it at the maximum value for the duration
of the time they remain in that morph. This may also
affect the skills linked to that aptitude, which must be
modified appropriately.

Some implants, gear, psi, and other factors may
modify a character’s natural aptitudes. These augmented
values may exceed a morph’s aptitude maximums,
as they represent external factors boosting the
morph’s ability. No aptitude, however, augmented or
not, may ever exceed a value of 40. Innate ability only
takes a person so far—after that point, actual skill is
what counts.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Eva has a Cognition aptitude of 25. She is unfortunately
forced to sleeve into a flat morph with an
aptitude maximum of 20. For the duration of the
period she inhabits that morph, her Cognition is
reduced to 20, which also impacts all of her COG-linked
skills, reducing them by 5.

</blockquote>
