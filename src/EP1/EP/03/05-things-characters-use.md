# THINGS CHARACTERS USE

In the advanced technological setting of *Eclipse Phase*,
characters don’t get by on their wits and morphs
alone; they take advantage of their credit and reputation
to acquire gear and implants and use their social
networks to gather information. Some characters also
have the capability to use mental powers known as psi.

## IDENTITY

In an age of ubiquitous computing and omnipresent
surveillance, privacy is a thing of the past—who
you are and what you do is easily accessed online.
Characters in *Eclipse Phase*, however, are often
involved in secretive or less-than-legal activities, so
the way to keep the bloggers, news, paparazzi, and
law off your back is to make extensive use of fake IDs.
While Firewall often provides covers for its sentinel
agents, it doesn’t hurt to keep a few extra personas
in reserve, in case matters ever go out the airlock in
a hurry. Thankfully, the patchwork allegiances of
city-state habitats and faction stations means that
identities aren’t too difficult to fake, and the ability
to switch morphs makes it even easier. On the other
hand, anyone with a copy of your biometrics or gene-
print is going to have an edge tracking you down or
finding any forensic traces you leave behind (for more
on ID, see [*Identity*](../09/06-identity.md)).

## SOCIAL NETWORKS

Social networks represent people the character knows
and social groups with which they interact. These
contacts, friends, and acquaintances are not just maintained
in person, but also through heavy Mesh contact.
Social software allows people to stay updated on what
the people they know are doing, where they are, and
what they are interested in, right up to the minute.
Social networks also incorporate the online projects
of individual members, whether it’s a mesh-site loaded
with a band member’s songs, a personal archive of
stored media, a decade of blog entries reviewing the
best places to score cheap electronics, or a depository
of research papers and studies someone has worked
on or finds interesting.

In game play, social networks are quite useful
to characters. Their friends list is an essential
resource—a pool of people you can actively poll for
ideas, troll for news, listen to for the latest rumors,
buy or sell gear from, hit up for expert advice, and
even ask for favors.

While a character’s social networks are nebulous
and constantly shifting, the use of them is not. A
character takes advantage of their social networks via
the [*Networking: \[Field\]*](../05/04-complete-skill-list.md#networking-field)
skill. The exact use of this skill is covered under
[*Reputation and Social Networks*](../09/09-reputation-social-networks.md).

## CRED

The Fall devastated the global economies and currencies
of the past. In the years of reconsolidation
that followed, the hypercorps and governments
inaugurated a new system-wide electronic monetary
system. Called *credit*, this currency is backed by all
of the large capitalist-oriented factions and is used to
trade for goods and services as well for other financia
transactions. Credit is mainly transferred electronically,
though certified credit chips are also common
(and favored for their anonymity). Hardcopy bills are
even used in some habitats.

Depending on your background or faction, your
character may be given an amount of credit at the
start of the game. During game play, your character
must earn credit the old-fashioned way: by earning
or stealing it.

## REP

Capitalism is no longer the only economy in town.
The development of nanofabricators allowed for the
existence of post-scarcity economies, a fact eagerly
taken advantage of by anarchist factions and others.
When anyone can make anything, concepts like
property and wealth become irrelevant. The advent
of functional gift and communist economies, among
other alternative economic models, means that in
such systems you can acquire any goods or services
you need via free exchange, reciprocity, or
barter—presuming you are a contributing member of such
a system and respected by your peers. Likewise, art,
creativity, innovation, and various forms of cultural
expression have a much higher worth than they do in
capitalist economies.

In alternative economies, money is often meaningless,
but *reputation* matters. Your reputation score
represents your social capital—how esteemed you
are to your peers. Rep can be increased by positively
influencing contributing to, or helping individuals or
groups, and it can be decreased through antisocial
behavior. In anarchist habitats, your likelihood of
obtaining things that you need is entirely based on
how you are viewed by others.

Reputation is easily measured by one of several
online social networks. Your actions are rewarded
or punished by those with whom you interact, who
can ping your Rep score with positive or negative
feedback. These networks are used by all of the factions,
as reputation can affect your social activities in
capitalist economies as well. The primary reputation
networks include:

- The @-list: the Circle-A list for anarchists, 
    Barsoomians, Extropians, scum, and Titanians,
    noted as @-rep.
- CivicNet: used by the Jovian Republic, Lunar-
    Lagrange Alliance, Morningstar Constellation,
    Planetary Consortium, and many hypercorps,
    referred to as c-rep.
- EcoWave: used by nano-ecologists, preservationists,
    and reclaimers, referred to as e-rep.
- Fame: the seen-and-be-seen network used by
    socialites, artists, glitterati, and media, referred
    to as f-rep.
- Guanxi: used by the triads and numerous criminal
    entities, referred to as g-rep.
- The Eye: used by Firewall, noted as i-rep.
- RNA: Research Network Affiliation used by
    argonauts, technologists, scientists, and researchers,
    referred to as r-rep.

Reputation is rated from 0–99. Depending on
your background and faction, you may start with
a Rep score in one or more networks. This can be
bolstered through spending customization points
during character creation. During game play, your
Rep scores depend entirely on your character’s
actions for more information, see
[*Reputation and Social Networks*](../09/09-reputation-social-networks.md).

Note that each Rep score is tied to a particular identity.

## GEAR

Gear is all of the equipment your character owns
and keeps on their person, from weapons and
armor to clothing and electronics. You buy gear for
your character with customization points during
character creation
(see [*Purchase Gear*](../04/01-character-generation.md#purchase-gear))
and in the game with Credit or Rep. Certain restricted,
illegal, or hard-to-find items may require special
efforts to obtain (see
[*Acquiring Gear*](../10/01-equipment-rules.md#acquiring-gear)).
If you have access to a nanofabricator, you may be
able to simply build gear, presuming you have the
proper blueprints (see
[*Nanofabrication*](../09/08-nanofabrication.md)).
For a complete listing of equipment options, see the
[*Gear*](../10/00-gear.md) chapter.

Even among the remaining capitalist economies,
prices can vary drastically. To represent this, all
gear falls into a cost category. Each category defines
a range of costs, so the gamemaster can adjust the
prices of individual items as appropriate to the situa-
tion. Each category also lists an average price for that
category, which is used during character generation
and any time the gamemaster wants to keep costs
simple. See the [Gear Costs table](../04/01-character-generation.md#gear-costs)






## IMPLANTS

Implants include cybernetic, bionic, genetech, and
nanoware enhancements to your character’s morph
(or mechanical enhancements in the case of a synthetic
shell). These implants may give your character
special abilities or modify their stats, skills, or traits.
Some morphs come pre-equipped with implants, as
noted in their descriptions (see [*Starting Morphs*](../04/02-starting-morphs.md)).
You may also special-order morphs with specific implants (see
[*Morph Acquisition*](../09/05-morph-brokerage.md#morph-acquisition)).
If you want to upgrade a morph you are already in, you can undergo
surgery or other treatments to have an enhancement
installed (see [*Healing Vats*](../10/09-nanotechnology.md#healing-vats)).
For a complete list of available implant/enhancement options, see
[*Personal Augmentation*](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md).

## PSI

Psi is a rare and anomalous set of mental abilities that
are acquired due to infection by a strange nanovirus
released during the Fall. Psi abilities are not completely
understood, but they give characters certain advantages—as
well as some disadvantages. A character
requires the [Psi trait](../04/03-traits.md#psi) to use psi abilities, which
are called *sleights*. Psi users are called *asyncs*. A full
explanation of psi and details on the various sleights
can be found in the [*Mind Hacks*](../07/00-mind-hacks.md) chapter.
