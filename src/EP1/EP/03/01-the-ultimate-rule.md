# The Ultimate Rule

One rule in *Eclipse Phase* outweighs all of the others:
have fun. This means that you should never let the
rules get in the way of the game. If you don’t like a rule,
change it. If you can’t find a rule, make one up. If you
disagree over a rule’s interpretation, flip a coin. Try not
to let rules interfere with the game’s flow and mood. If
you’re in the middle of a really good scene or intense
roleplaying and a rule suddenly comes into question,
don’t stop the game to look it up and argue about it. Just
wing it, make a decision quickly, and move on. You can
always look the rule up later so you’ll remember it next
time. If there are disagreements over a rule’s interpretation,
remember that the gamemaster gets the final say.

This rule also means that you shouldn’t let the story
be guided solely by rolls of the dice. The element of
chance that dice rolls provide lends a sense of randomness,
uncertainty, and surprise to the game. Sometimes
this is exciting, like when a character makes an
unexpectedly difficult roll and saves the day. At other
times, it is brutal, such as when a lucky shot from an
opponent takes one of the characters out for good in a
fight If the gamemaster wants a scenario to result in a
pre-planned dramatic outcome and an unexpected die
roll threatens that plan, they should feel free to ignore
that roll and move the story in the direction they desire.

## Dice

*Eclipse Phase* uses two ten-sided dice (each noted as
a *d10*) for random rolls. In most cases, the rules will
call for a percentile roll, noted as *d100*, meaning that
you roll two ten-sided dice, choosing one to count first
and then read them as a result between 0 and 99 (with
a roll of 00 counting as zero, not 100). The first die
counts as the tens digit, and the second die counts as
the ones digit. For example, you roll two ten-sided
dice, one red and one black, calling out red first The
red one rolls a 1 and the black die rolls a 6, for a result
of 16. Some sets of d10s, as shown above, are specifically
marked for easier rolling and reading.

Occasionally the rules will call for individual die
rolls, with each individual ten-sided die listed as a *d10*.
If the rules call for several dice to be rolled, it will
be noted as 2d10, 3d10, and so on. When multiple
ten-sided dice are rolled in these instances, the results
are added together. For example, a 3d10 roll of 4,
6, and 7 counts as 17. On d10 rolls, a result of 0 is
treated as a 10, not a zero.

Most players of *Eclipse Phase* can get by with
having two ten-sided dice, but it doesn’t hurt to
have more on hand. These dice can be purchased
at your friendly local game store or borrowed from
another gamer.

## A NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY AND GENDER

The Eclipse Phase setting raises a number of interesting
questions about gender and personal identity.
What does it mean when you are born female but
you are occupying a male body? When it comes to
language and editing, this also poses a number of
interesting questions for what pronouns to use. The
English language has a bit of a bias towards
male-gendered pronouns that we hope to avoid in these rules.

For purposes of this game, we’ve sidestepped some of
these gender neutrality quandaries by adopting
the “Singular They” rule. What this means is that
rather than just going with male pronouns (“he”) or
switching between gendered pronouns (“he” in one chapter,
“she” in the next), we have adopted the
use of “they” even when referring to a single person.
To some folks, this is bad grammar, but there is
actually some good evidence that this usage has
strong historical roots (look it up), and it certainly gives
our editors fewer headaches.

When referring to specific characters, we use the
gendered pronoun appropriate to the character’s
personal gender identity, no matter the sex of
the morph they are in.

## MAKING TESTS

In *Eclipse Phase*, your character is bound to fin
themself in adrenalin-pumping action scenes, high-stress
social situations, lethal combats, spine-tingling
investigations, and similar situations filled with drama,
risk, and adventure. When your character is embroiled
in these scenarios, you determine how well they do by
*making tests*—rolling dice to determine if they succeed
or fail, and to what degree.

You make tests in *Eclipse Phase* by rolling d100 and
comparing the result to a target number. The target
number is typically determined by one of your char-
acter’s skills (discussed below) and ranges between 1
and 98. If you roll *less than or equal* to the target
number, you succeed (though the closer you get to the
target number, the better). If you roll *higher* than the
target number, you fail.

A roll of 00 is *always* considered a success. A roll of
99 is *always* a failure.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Jaqui’s character needs to make a skill test. Her
skill is 55. Jaqui takes two ten-sided dice and
rolls a 53—she succeeds! If she had rolled a 55,
she still would have been successful, but any roll
higher than that would have been a failure.

</blockquote>

## TARGET NUMBERS
As noted above, the target number for a d100 roll in
*Eclipse Phase* is usually the skill rating. Occasionally,
however, a different figure will be used. In some
cases, an aptitude score is used, which makes for
much harder tests as aptitude scores are usually well
below 50 (see [*Aptitudes*](./04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes)). In other tests, the
target number will be an aptitude rating × 2 or × 3 or
two aptitudes added together. In these cases, the test
description will note what rating(s) to use.

## WHEN TO MAKE TESTS

The gamemaster decides when a character must
make a test. As a rule of thumb, tests are called for
whenever there is a chance that a character might fail
at an action or when success or failure may have an
effect on the ongoing story. Tests are also called for
whenever two or more characters act in opposition to
one another (for example, if they are arm wrestling or
haggling over a price). On the other hand, routine use
of a skill by someone with at least a rating of 30 in
that skill can be assumed to be successful with no test.

It is not necessary to make tests for everyday, run-of-
the-mill activities, such as getting dressed or checking
your email (especially in *Eclipse Phase*, where so many
activities are automatically handled by the machines
around you). Even an activity such as driving a car
does not call for dice rolls as long as you have a small
modicum of skill. A test might be necessary, however,
if you happen to be driving while bleeding to death or
are pursuing a gang of motorcycle-riding scavengers
through the ruins of a devastated city.

Knowing when to call for tests and when to let the
roleplaying flow without interruption is a skill every
gamemaster must acquire. Sometimes it is better to
simply make a call without rolling dice in order to
maintain the pacing of the game. Likewise, in certain
circumstances the gamemaster may decide to make tests
for a character in secret, without the player noticing. If
an enemy is trying to sneak past a character on guard,
for example, the gamemaster will alert the player that
something is amiss if they ask them to make a perception
test. This means that the gamemaster should keep a copy
of each character’s record sheet on hand at all times.

### DIFFICULTY AND MODIFIERS

The measure of a test’s difficulty is reflected in its modifiers.
Modifiers are adjustments made to the target number (not the
roll), either raising or lowering it. A test of average difficult
will have no modifiers whereas actions that are easier will have
positive modifiers (raising the target number, making success
more likely) and harder actions will have negative modifiers
(lowering the target number, making success less likely). It is
the gamemaster’s job to determine if a particular test is harder
or easier than normal and to what degree (as illustrated on the
Test Difficulty table) and to then apply the appropriate modifier.

### TEST DIFFICULTY

|   DIFFICULTY LEVEL    |   MODIFIER    |
|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
|   Effortless          |   +30         |
|   Simple              |   +20         |
|   Easy                |   +10         |
|   Average             |   +0          |
|   Difficult           |   –10         |
|   Challenging         |   –20         |
|   Hard                |   –30         |

Other factors might also play a role in a test, applying additional
modifiers aside from the test’s general level of difficult.
These factors include the environment, equipment (or
lack thereof), and the health of the character, among
other things. The character might be using superior
tools, working in poor conditions, or even wounded,
and each of these factors must be taken into account,
applying additional modifiers to the target number
and adjusting the likelihood of success or failure.

For simplicity, modifiers are applied in multiples
of 10 and come in three levels of severity: Minor (+/–10),
Moderate (+/–20), and Major (+/–30). Any number of
modifiers apply as the gamemaster deems appropriate,
but the cumulative modifiers may not exceed +/–60.

### MODIFIER SEVERITY

|   DIFFICULTY LEVEL    |   MODIFIER    |
|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
|   Minor               |   +/– 10      |
|   Moderate            |   +/– 20      |
|   Major               |   +/– 30      |

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Jaqui is attemting to leap from one door to another
across a large chamber in zero gravity. She’s in a hurry.
If she misses the door, she’ll lose valuable time, so
the gamemaster calls for a Freefall Skill Test.
Jaqui’s Freefall skill is 46. Unfortunately
the chamber is filled with floating debris that could
get in her way. The gamemaster determines this is a
Moderate modifier, reducing the target number by 20.
Jaqui must roll a 26 or less to succeed.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

## SIMPLIFYING MODIFIERS

Rather than looking up and accumulating a
long list of modifiers for each action and doing
the math, the gamemaster can instead choose
to simply “eyeball” the situation and apply the
modifier that best sums up the net effect. This
method is quicker and allows for easier test
resolution. One way to eyeball the situation is
to simply apply the most severe modifier affecting
the situation.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Tyska is trying to escape from some thing that’s
chasing him through a derelict habitat. The
gamemaster calls for a Freerunning Test, but
there are a number of modifying conditions: it’s
dark, he’s running with a flashlight, and there’s
debris everywhere. Tyska, however, has an entoptic
map of the best route out of there to help
him out. The gamemaster assesses the situation
and decides the overall effect is that the test is
challenging, and so a –20 modifier is applied.

</blockquote>

## NARRATIVE MODIFIERS

If you wish to develop a more cinematic feel
for your game, or if you simply wish to encourage
your players to invest more detail and
creativity into the storyline, you can award
“narrative modifiers” to a character’s test when
that player describes what the character is
doing in exceptionally colorful, inventive, or
dramatic detail. The better the detail, the
better the modifier.

<blockquote>


### EXAMPLE:

Cole doesn’t just want his character to jump
over the table, he wants to make an impact.
Cole tells the gamemaster that his character
kicks a chair out of the way, rolls over the dinner
table on his shoulder, grabs a fork as he does
it, makes sure to knock all of the fine china on
the floor, then lands on his feet in a defensive
martial arts posture, fork raised high. The game-
master decides the extra description is worth
+10 to his Freerunning Test.

</blockquote>



</blockquote>

## CRITICALS: ROLLING DOUBLES

Any time both dice come up with the same number—00, 11, 22, 33,
44, etc.—you have scored a critical
success or critical failure, depending on whether your
roll also beats your target number. 00 is always a
critical success, whereas 99 is always a critical failure.
Rolling doubles means that a little something extra
happened with the outcome of the test, either positive
or negative. Criticals have a very specific application
in combat tests ([*Combat*](../06/05-combat.md)), but for all other purposes
the gamemaster decides what exactly went wrong or
right in a specific situation. Criticals can be used to
amplify a success or failure: you finish with a flourish
or fail so spectacularly that you remain the butt
of jokes for weeks to come. They can also result in
some sort of unexpected secondary effect: you repair
the device and improve its performance; or you fail
to shoot your enemy and hit an innocent bystander.
Alternately, a critical can be used to give a boost (or
a hindrance) to a follow-up action. For example, you
not only spot a clue, but you immediately suspect it
to be red herring; or you not only fail to strike the
target, but your weapon breaks, leaving you defenseless.
Gamemasters are encouraged to be inventive with
their use of criticals and choose results that create
comedy, drama, or tension.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Audrey is attempting to intimidate a low-level triad
mook into giving her information. Unfortunately
she rolls a 99—a critical failure. Not only does
she fail to scare the guy, but she accidentally lets
slip an important piece of information that she
didn’t want the triad to know. If she rolled a 00
instead—a critical success—she would browbeat
the man so thoroughly that he throws in some
extra important information just so she’ll leave
him alone in the future.

</blockquote>

## DEFAULTING: UNTRAINED SKILL USE

Certain tests may call for a character to use a skill they
don’t have—a process called *defaulting*. In this case,
the character instead uses the rating of the aptitude
([*Aptitudes*](./04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes))
that is linked to the skill in question as the
target number.

Not all skills may be defaulted; some of them are
so complex or require such training than an unskilled
character can’t hope to succeed. Skills that may not be
defaulted on are noted on the [*Skill List*](../05/04-complete-skill-list.md) and
in the skill description.

In rare cases, a gamemaster might allow a character
to default to another skill that also relates to a test 
(see [*Defaulting to Related Skills*](../05/02-using-skills.md#defaulting-to-related-skills)).
When allowed, defaulting to another skill incurs a –30 modifier.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Toljek is trying to casually sneak inside a hyper-
corp facility when he unexpectedly runs into a
hypercorp employee. The woman he’s encountered
doesn’t necessarily have grounds to be suspicious
of Toljek’s presence, but the gamemaster calls for
Toljek to make a Protocol Test to pass himself off
as someone that belongs there. Unfortunately,
Toljek doesn’t have that skill, so he must default to
its linked aptitude, Savvy, instead. His Savvy score
is only 18, so Toljek better hope he gets lucky.

</blockquote>

## TEAMWORK

If two or more characters join forces to tackle a test
together, one of the characters must be chosen as the
primary actor. This leading character will usually (but
not always) be the one with the highest applicable skill.
The primary acting character is the one who rolls the
test, though they receive a +10 modifier for each
additional character helping them out, up to a maximum
+30 modifie . Note that helping characters do not
necessarily need to know the skill being used if the
gamemaster decides that they can follow the primary actor’s lead.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

The robotic leg on Eva’s synthetic morph is badly
damaged, so she needs to repair it. Max and Vic
both sit down and help her out, giving her a +20
modifier (+10 for each helper) to her Hardware:
Robotics Test.
