# The Ultimate Rule

One rule in *Eclipse Phase* outweighs all of the others:
have fun. This means that you should never let the
rules get in the way of the game. If you don’t like a rule,
change it. If you can’t find a rule, make one up. If you
disagree over a rule’s interpretation, flip a coin. Try not
to let rules interfere with the game’s flow and mood. If
you’re in the middle of a really good scene or intense
roleplaying and a rule suddenly comes into question,
don’t stop the game to look it up and argue about it. Just
wing it, make a decision quickly, and move on. You can
always look the rule up later so you’ll remember it next
time. If there are disagreements over a rule’s interpretation,
remember that the gamemaster gets the final say.

This rule also means that you shouldn’t let the story
be guided solely by rolls of the dice. The element of
chance that dice rolls provide lends a sense of randomness,
uncertainty, and surprise to the game. Sometimes
this is exciting, like when a character makes an
unexpectedly difficult roll and saves the day. At other
times, it is brutal, such as when a lucky shot from an
opponent takes one of the characters out for good in a
fight If the gamemaster wants a scenario to result in a
pre-planned dramatic outcome and an unexpected die
roll threatens that plan, they should feel free to ignore
that roll and move the story in the direction they desire.

## Dice

*Eclipse Phase* uses two ten-sided dice (each noted as
a *d10*) for random rolls. In most cases, the rules will
call for a percentile roll, noted as *d100*, meaning that
you roll two ten-sided dice, choosing one to count first
and then read them as a result between 0 and 99 (with
a roll of 00 counting as zero, not 100). The first die
counts as the tens digit, and the second die counts as
the ones digit. For example, you roll two ten-sided
dice, one red and one black, calling out red first The
red one rolls a 1 and the black die rolls a 6, for a result
of 16. Some sets of d10s, as shown above, are specifically
marked for easier rolling and reading.

Occasionally the rules will call for individual die
rolls, with each individual ten-sided die listed as a *d10*.
If the rules call for several dice to be rolled, it will
be noted as 2d10, 3d10, and so on. When multiple
ten-sided dice are rolled in these instances, the results
are added together. For example, a 3d10 roll of 4,
6, and 7 counts as 17. On d10 rolls, a result of 0 is
treated as a 10, not a zero.

Most players of *Eclipse Phase* can get by with
having two ten-sided dice, but it doesn’t hurt to
have more on hand. These dice can be purchased
at your friendly local game store or borrowed from
another gamer.
