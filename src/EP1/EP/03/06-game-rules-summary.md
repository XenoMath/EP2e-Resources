# GAME RULES SUMMARY

Everything you need to know about the rules—summed up on a single page.

## [MAKING TESTS](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#making-tests)

- Roll d100 (two ten-sided dice, read as a percentile
    amount, from 00 to 99).
- Target number is determined by the appropriate skill
    (or occasionally an aptitude).
- Difficulty is represented by modifiers.
- 00 is always a success.
- 99 is always a failure.
- Margin of Success of 30+ is an Excellent Success.
- Margin of Failure of 30+ is a Severe Failure.
- A roll of doubles (00, 11, 22, 33, etc.) equals a critical
    success or failure.

## [SUCCESS TESTS](./02-types-tests.md#success-tests)

- To succeed, roll d100 and score equal to or less than
the skill +/– modifiers.

## [OPPOSED TESTS](./02-types-tests.md#opposed-tests)

- Each character rolls d100 against their skill +/– modifiers.
- The character who succeeds with the highest roll
    wins. If both characters fail, or both succeed but tie,
    deadlock occurs.

## [SIMPLE SUCCESS TESTS](./02-types-tests.md#simple-success-tests)

- Simple Success Tests automatically succeed.
- Success or failure on the roll simply indicates if the
    character succeeded strongly or poorly.

## [DEFAULTING](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#defaulting-untrained-skill-use)

- If a character does not have the appropriate skill for a
    test, they may default to the skill’s linked aptitude.

## [MODIFIERS](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#difficulty-and-modifiers)

- Modifiers always affect the target number (skill), not
    the roll.
- Modifiers (positive or negative) come in 3 levels of severity:
    - Minor (+/–10)
    - Moderate (+/–20)
    - Major (+/–30)
- The maximum modifiers that can be applied are +/– 60.

## [TEAMWORK](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#teamwork)

- One character is chosen as the primary actor; they
    make the test.
- Each helper character adds a +10 modifier (max. +30).

## [TAKING EXTRA TIME](./02-types-tests.md#taking-extra-time)

- Character may take extra time to complete an action.
- On Complex actions, each minute taken adds +10 to
    the test.
- On Task actions, every 50 percent extension to the
    timeframe adds +10 to the test.

## [APTITUDES](./04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes)

- Aptitudes range from 1 to 30 (average 15).
- Aptitudes are: Cognition, Coordination, Intuition,
    Reflexes, Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower.

## [LEARNED SKILLS](./04-defining-your-character.md#learned-skills)

- Skills range from 1–99 (average 50).
- Each skill is linked to and based on an aptitude.
- Morphs, gear, drugs, etc. may provide skill bonuses or
    penalties to individual skills.

## [SPECIALIZATIONS](./04-defining-your-character.md#specializations)

- Specializations add +10 when using a skill for that
    area of concentration.
- Each skill may have only one specialization.

## [ACTION TURNS](./03-time-actions.md#action-turns)

- Action Turns are 3 seconds in length.
- The order in which characters act is determined by
    Initiative.
- Automatic actions are always “on.”
- Characters may take any number of Quick Actions in a
    Turn (minimum of 3), limited only by the gamemaster.
- Characters may only take a number of Complex
    Actions equal to their Speed stat.

## [TASK ACTIONS](./03-time-actions.md#task-actions)

- Task Actions are any action that requires longer than
    1 Action Turn to complete.
- Task Actions list a timeframe (anywhere from 2 Turns
    to 2 years).
- Timeframe reduced by 10% for each 10 points of MoS.
- If character fails, they work on the task for a
    minimum period equal to 10% of the timeframe for
    each 10 points of MoF before realizing it’s a failure.
