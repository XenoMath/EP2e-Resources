# TYPES OF TESTS
There are two types of tests in *Eclipse Phase:* Success
and Opposed.

## SUCCESS TESTS

Success Tests are called for whenever a character is
acting without direct opposition. They are the
standard tests used to determine how well a character
exercises a particular skill or ability.

Success Tests are handled exactly as described under
[*Making Tests*](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#making-tests).
The player rolls d100 against a
target number equal to the character’s skill +/– modifiers.
If they roll equal to or less than the target number,
the test succeeds, and the action is completed as desired.
If they roll higher than the target number, the test fails.

### TRYING AGAIN

If you fail at a test, you can take another shot. Each
subsequent attempt at an action after a failure,
however, incurs a cumulative –10 modifier. That
means the second try suffers –10, the third –20, the
fourth –30, and so on, up to the maximum –60.

### TAKING EXTRA TIME

Most skill tests are made for Automatic, Quick, or
Complex Actions (see 
[*Types of Actions*](./03-time-actions.md#types-of-actions))
and so are resolved within one Action Turn (3 seconds, see
[*Action Turns*](./03-time-actions.md#action-turns)). Tests made for
[Task actions](./03-time-actions.md#task-actions)
take longer.

Players may choose to take extra time when their
character undertakes an action, meaning that they
choose to be especially careful when performing the
action in order to enhance their chance of success. For
every minute of extra time they take, they increase
their target number by +10. Once they’ve modifie
their target number to over 99, they are practically
assured of success, so the gamemaster can waive the
dice roll and grant them an automatic success. Note
that the maximum +60 modifier rule still applies, so if
their skill is under 40 to start with, taking extra time
may still not guarantee a favorable outcome. You may
take extra time even when defaulting
(see [*Defaulting: Untrained Skill Use*](./01-the-ultimate-rule.md#defaulting-untrained-skill-use)).

Taking extra time is a solid choice when time is not
a factor to the character, as it eliminates the chance
that a critical failure will be rolled and allows the
player to skip needless dice rolling. For certain tests it
may not be appropriate, however, if the gamemaster
decides that no amount of extra time will increase the
likelihood of success. In that case, the gamemaster
simply rules that taking extra time has no effect.

For [Task action](./03-time-actions.md#task-actions) tests, which already take
time to complete, the duration of the task must be
increased by 50 percent for each +10 modifier gained
for taking extra time.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Srit is searching through an abandoned spaceship,
looking for a sign of what happened to the
missing crew. The gamemaster tells her it will take
twenty minutes to search the whole ship. She
wants to be extra thorough, however, so she takes
an extra thirty minutes. Fifty percent of the original
timeframe is ten minutes, so taking an extra thirty
minutes means that Srit receives a +30 modifier to
her Investigation Test.

</blockquote>

### SIMPLE SUCCESS TESTS

In some circumstances, the gamemaster may not be
concerned that a character might fail a test, but instead
simply wants to gauge how well the character performs.
In this case, the gamemaster calls for a *Simple Success Test*,
which is handled just like a standard
[*Success Test*](./02-types-tests.md#success-tests).
Rather than determining success or failure,
however, the test is assumed to succeed. The roll
determines whether the character succeeds *strongly* (rolls
equal to or less than the target number) or succeeds
*weakly* (rolls above the target number).

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Dav is taking a short spacewalk between two
parked ships. The gamemaster determines that this
is a routine operation and calls for Dav to make a
Simple Success Test using the Freefall skill. Dav’s
skill is only 35. He rolls a 76, but the gamemaster
merely determines that Dav has some trouble
orienting himself and has to take some extra time.
If Dav had rolled a 77—a critical failure—his suit’s
maneuvering jets may have died and he may have
accidentally propelled himself into deep space.

</blockquote>

### MARGIN OF SUCCESS/FAILURE

Sometimes it may be important that a character not
only succeeds, but that they kick ass and take names
while doing it. This is usually true of situations where
the challenge is not only difficult but the action must
be pulled off with finesse. Tests of this sort may call
for a certain *Margin of Success (MoS)*. MoS is simply
determined by what the character rolled on a successful
test. For example, a character who rolls a 20 against a
target number of 55 succeeds with an MoS of 20. The
higher the character rolls while still making it equal
to or less than the target number, the higher the MoS.
Higher skills thus make it possible to get a higher MoS.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

An enemy has thrown an incendiary device near
Stoya. She has only a moment to act and decides
to try to kick it away from herself. Even better, she
hopes to kick it into the open maintenance hatch
a dozen meters away. The gamemaster determines
that in order to kick it into the hatch, Stoya needs to
succeed with an MoS of 30. Her Unarmed Combat
skill is 65, so Stoya needs to roll 65 or less to kick
the device away (though she may still be damaged
when it explodes) and 30 or higher to kick it into
the hatch (in which case she will be completely safe
when it detonates). She rolls a 32—a success with a
high enough MoS to kick it in the hatch!

</blockquote>

At other times, it may be important to know how
badly a character fails as determined by a
*Margin of Failure (MoF)*, which is the amount by which the
character rolled over the target number. In some cases,
a test may note that a character who fails with a
certain MoF may suffer additional consequences for
failing so dismally.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Nico is trying to sketch out a picture of someone’s
face. He has eidetic memory, but his drawing needs
to be good enough for someone else to identify
the person. He rolls against his Art: Drawing skill
of 34, scoring a 97—an MoF of 63. The illustration
is so bad that the gamemaster determines that
anyone using that picture to identify the person
will need to score an MoS of at least 63 on a
Perception Test to recognize the person.

</blockquote>

### EXCELLENT SUCCESSES/SEVERE FAILURES

Excellent Successes and Severe Failures are a method
used to benchmark successes and failures with an
MoS or MoF of 30+. Excellent Successes are used in
situations where an especially good roll may boost the
intended effect, such as inflicting more damage with
a good hit in combat. Severe Failures denote a roll
that is particularly bad and has a worse effect than a
simple failure. Neither Excellent Successes or Severe
Failures are as good or bad as criticals, however.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Stoya has been caught in a deal gone bad. She
moves to kick her opponent using her Unarmed
Combat of 65. She rolls a 33 (for an MoS of 33),
and her opponent rolls a 21 (also successful, but
less than Stoya, so she wins). She has succeeded
and beaten her opponent with an MoS of 30+,
scoring an Excellent Success, meaning she will
inflict extra damage with the kick.

</blockquote>

## OPPOSED TESTS

An Opposed Test is called for whenever a character’s
action may be directly opposed by another. Regardless
of who initiates the action, both characters must make
a test against each other, with the outcome favoring
the winner.

To make an Opposed Test, each character rolls d100
against a target number equal to the relevant skill(s)
along with any appropriate modifiers If only one of
the characters succeeds (rolls equal to or less than their
target number), that character has won. If both succeed,
the character who gets the highest dice roll wins. If
both characters fail, or they both succeed and roll the
same number, then a deadlock occurs—the charac-
ters remain pitted against each other, neither gaining
ground, until one of them takes another action and
either breaks away or makes another Opposed Test.

Note that critical successes trump high rolls in an
Opposed Test—if both characters succeed and one rolls
54 while the other rolls 44, the critical roll of 44 wins.

Care must be taken when applying modifiers in an
Opposed Test. Some modifiers will affect both participants
equally, and should be applied to both tests. If
a modifier arises from one character’s advantage in
relation to the other, however, that modifier should
only be applied to benefit the favored character; it
should not also be applied as a negative modifier to
the disadvantaged character.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Zhou has been hired by the Jovian Republic to
infiltrate his old pirate band. Even though he’s
resleeved in a new skin, he’s worried that one of
his old buddies, Wen, might recognize his mannerisms,
since they lived, whored, and raided together
for years. After Zhou has spent some time in
Wen’s company, the gamemaster makes a secret
Opposed Test, pitting Zhou’s Impersonation skill of
57 against Wen’s Kinesics of 34. The gamemaster
decides to give Wen a bonus +20, since he is so
familiar with his former buddy and has been on the
lookout for him, eager to repay the old grudge that
split them apart. Wen’s target number is now 54.

The gamemaster rolls for both. Zhou scores a
45 and Wen a 39. Both succeed, but Zhou rolled
higher, so his deception is successful. The gamemaster
decides that Wen finds something about
Zhou to be familiar, but he can’t put his finger on it.

</blockquote>

### OPPOSED TESTS AND MARGIN OF SUCCESS/FAILURE

In some cases, it may also be important to note a character’s
Margin of Success or Failure in an Opposed Test,
as with a Success Test above. In this case, the MoS/MoF
is still simply determined by the character’s roll—it is
not measured against the opposing character’s roll.

### VARIABLE OPPOSED TEST

In some cases, the rules will call for a *Variable Opposed Test*,
which allows for slightly more outcomes than a
standard Opposed Test. If both characters succeed in
a Variable Opposed Test, then an outcome is obtained
which is different from just one character winning over
the other. The exact outcomes are noted with each specific
Variable Opposed Test.

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE:

Jaqui needs to hack into a local network to
retrieve some video footage. The network is
actively defended by an AI, so a Variable Opposed
Test is called for, pitting Jaqui’s Infosec skill of 48
against the AI’s Infosec of 25. Jaqui rolls a 48—a
success—but the AI rolls a 14—also a success. In
this circumstance, Jaqui succeeds in hacking in,
but the AI is aware of the infiltration and can take
active countermeasures against her.
