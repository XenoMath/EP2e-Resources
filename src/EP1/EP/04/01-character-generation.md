# CHARACTER GENERATION

There are two parts to every player character. The
first is the sets of numbers and attributes that defin
what a character is good or bad at (or even what they
can and can’t do) according to the game mechanics.
These are more than just statistics, however—these
characteristics help to define your character’s abilities
and interests and by extension their background,
education, training, and experience. During the
character creation process, you will have the ability
to assign, adjust, and juggle these characteristics as
you like. If you have a pre-conceived notion of what
the character is about, you can optimize the stats to
reflect that. Alternatively, you can tweak the stats until
you get something you like, then base the character’s
backstory off of what you develop.

The second part to every player character is their
personality. What defines them as a person? What
makes them tick? What pisses them off? What sparks
their interest? What positive aspects of their personality
make them appealing as a friend, comrade, or
lover—or at least someone interesting to play? What
character flaws and quirks do they have? These questions
matter because they will also guide you as you
assign stats, skills, and traits.

Character generation is a step-by-step process.
Unlike some games, the process for creating an
*Eclipse Phase* character is not random—you have
complete control over every aspect of your character’s
design. Some stages must be completed before
you can move on to others. The complete process is
broken down on the Step-By-Step Guide to Character
Creation sidebar.

## CHARACTER CONCEPT

Deciding what/who you want to play before you make
the character is usually the best route. Pick a simple
archetype that fits your character and work from there.
Do you want to play an explorer? Someone sneaky,
like a spy or thief? Someone cerebral, like a scientist?
A hardened criminal or ex-cop? Or do you prefer to
be a rabble-rousing agitator? You can also start with a
personality type and choose an associated profession. If
you want a social butterfly who excels at manipulating
people, you can play a media personality, blogger, or
party-going socialite. Perhaps you’d prefer a bottomed-out
reject with substance abuse problems, in which
case an ex-merc or former hypercapitalist who lost
their fortune and family during the Fall might fit How
about an energetic, live-life-to-the-fullest, must-see-it-all
character? Then a habitat freerunner or professional
gatecrasher might be what you’re looking for.

Make sure to check in with the other players and
try to create a character that’s complementary to the
rest of the team—preferably one who provides some
skill-set the group lacks. Why create a research
archeologist if someone else is already set on playing one,
especially when the team lacks a good combat specialist
or async? On the other hand, if your team is going
to be running an alien archeological expedition, then
having more than one researcher (each with distinct
areas of expertise) might not be bad.

Once you have the basic concept, try to fill it in
with a few more details, making it into a one-sentence
summary. If you started with the concept of “xeno­
sociologist,” expand it to “open-minded amateur
linguist and expert xenosociologist who is fascinated
by alien cultures, collects Factor kitsch, has a high
tolerance for ‘yuck factors,’ and whose best friends tend
to be uplifts and AIs.” This will give you a few more
details around which you can focus the character’s
strengths and weaknesses.

## CHOOSE BACKGROUND

The first step to creating your character is to choose a
background. Was your character born on Earth before
the Fall? Were they raised on a habitat commune? Or
did they start existence as a disembodied AI?

You must choose one of the backgrounds for your
character from the list below. Choose wisely, as each
background may provide your character with certain
skills, traits, limitations, or other characteristics to
start with. Keep in mind that your background is
where you came from, not who you are now. It is
the past, whereas your faction represents whom your
character is currently aligned with. Your future, of
course, is yours to make.

The background options presented below cover
a wide selection of transhumanity, but they cannot
cover every possibility. If your gamemaster allows it,
you may work with them to develop a background
that is not included on this list, using these as guidelines
to keep it balanced.

### DRIFTER

You were raised with a social grouping that remained
on the move throughout the Sol system. This could
have been free traders, pirates, asteroid farmers,
scavengers, or just migrant workers. You are used to
roaming space travel between habitats and stations. 
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Navigation skill, +20 Pilot: Spacecraft
    skill, +10 Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All, especially Bouncers and Hibernoids

</div>





### FALL EVACUEE

You were born and raised on Earth and evacuated
during the horrors of the Fall, leaving your old life
(and possibly your friends, family, and loved ones)
behind you. You were lucky enough to survive with
your body intact and continue to make a life for yourself
out in the system.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10
    Networking: [Field] skill of your choice, +1 Moxie
- **Disadvantages:** Only 2,500 Starting Credit (can still
    buy credit with CP)
- **Common Morphs:** Flats, Splicers

</div>


### HYPERELITE

You are privileged to have been raised as part of the
immortal upper class that rules many inner system
habitats and hypercorps. You were pampered with
wealth and influence that most people can only
dream of.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Protocol skill, +10,000 Credit, +20
    Networking: Hypercorps skill
- **Disadvantages:** May not start with flat splicer, or any
    pod, uplift, or synthetic morphs
- **Common Morphs:** Exalts, Sylphs

</div>

### INFOLIFE

You entered existence as a digital consciousness—an
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Your very
existence is illegal in certain habitats (a legacy of
those who place the Fall at the feet of rampant AIs).
Unlike the seed AIs responsible for their Fall, your
capacity for self-improvement is limited, though you
do have full autonomy.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +30 Interfacing skill, Computer skills
    (Infosec, Interfacing, Programming, Research)
    bought with Customization Points are half price
- **Disadvantages:** Real World Naiveté trait, Social Stigma
    (AGI) trait, Social skills bought with Customization
    Points are double price
- **Common Morphs:** Infomorphs, synthetic morphs

</div>

### ISOLATE

You were raised as part of a self-exiled grouping on
the fringes of the system. Whether raised as part of
a religious group, cult, social experiment, anti-tech
cell, or a group that just wanted to be isolated, you
spent most if not all of your upbringing isolated
from other factions.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +20 to two skills of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** –10 starting Rep
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### LOST

You are a legacy of one of the most infamous debacles
since the Fall. As a member of the “Lost generation,”
you went through an accelerated-growth childhood,
somehow surviving where others of your kind died,
went insane, or were persecuted (see [*The Lost*](../07/03-psychosurgery.md#the-lost)).
Your background is a social stigma, but it does provide
you with certain advantages … and burdens.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +20 to two Knowledge skills of your
    choice, Psi trait (Level 1)
- **Disadvantages:** Mental Disorder (choose two, this
    includes the one from Psi) trait, Social Stigma (Lost)
    trait, must start with Futura morph
- **Common Morphs:** Futuras

</div>

### LUNAR COLONIST

You experienced your childhood in one of the cramped
dome cities or underground stations on Luna, Earth’s
moon. You had a ringside seat to the Fall of Earth.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to one
    Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession: [Field] skill
    of your choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** Flats, Splicers

</div>

### MARTIAN

You were raised in a station on or above Mars, now
the most populated planet in the system. Your home
town may or may not have survived the Fall.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to
    one Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession: [Field]
    skill of your choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** Flats, Splicers, and Rusters

</div>

### ORIGINAL SPACE COLONIST

You or your parents were part of the first “generations”
of colonists/workers sent out from Earth to stake a
claim in space, so you are familiar with the cramped
confines of spaceflight and life aboard older stations
and habitats. As a “zero-one g” (zero-gravity, first
gen), you were never part of the elite. People from
your background typically have some sort of specialized
tech training as vacworkers or habtechs.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Spacecraft or Freefall skill,
    +10 to a Technical, Academic: [Field], or Profession: [Field]
    skill of your choice, +20 to a Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All. Use of exotic morphs is common

</div>

### RE-INSTANTIATED

You were born and raised on Earth, but you did not
survive the Fall. All that you know is that your body
died there, but your backup was transmitted offworld,
and you were one of the lucky few to be re-instantiated
with a new morph. You may have spent years in dead
storage, simulspace, or as an infomorph slave.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill, +10 to a
    Networking: [Field] skill of your choice, +2 Moxie
- **Disadvantages:** Edited Memories trait, 0 Starting Credit
    (can still buy credit with CP)
- **Common Morphs:** Cases, Infomorphs, Synths

</div>

### SCUMBORN

You were raised in the nomadic and chaotic lifestyle
common to scum barges.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Persuasion or Deception skill, +10 Scrounging skill,
    +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All, especially Bouncers

</div>

### UPLIFT

You are not even human. You were born as an uplifted
animal: chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, parrot, raven,
crow, or octopus.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Fray skill, +10 Perception skill, +20 to
    two Knowledge skills of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** Must choose an uplift morph to start
- **Common Morphs:** Neo-Avian, Neo-Hominid, Octomorph

</div>

## CHOOSE FACTION

After choosing your background, you now choose
which primary faction your character belongs to.
This faction most likely represents the grouping that
controls your character’s current home habitat/station,
and to which your character holds allegiance, but this
need not be the case. You may be a dissident member
of your faction, living among them but opposing some
(or all) of their core memes and perhaps agitating for
change. Whatever the case, your faction defines how
your character represents themself in the struggle
between ideologies post-Fall.

You must choose one of the factions listed below.
Like your character’s background, it will provide your
character with certain skills, traits, limitations, or
other characteristics.

The factions presented here outline the most numerous
and influential among transhumanity, but others
may also exist. At your gamemaster’s discretion, you
may develop another starting faction with them not
included on this list.

### ANARCHIST

You are opposed to hierarchy, favoring flat forms of
social organization and directly democratic decision-making.
You believe power is always corrupting and
everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect
their lives. According to the primitive and restrictive
policies of the inner system and Jovian Junta, this
makes you an irresponsible hoodlum at best and a
terrorist at worst. In your opinion, that’s comedy coming
from governments that keep their populations in line
with economic oppression and threats of violence.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to a skill of your choice, +30 Networking: Autonomists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### ARGONAUT

You are part of a scientific technoprogressive movement
that seeks to solve transhumanity’s injustices and
inequalities with technology. You support universal
access to technology and healthcare, open-source
models of production, morphological freedom, and
democratization. You try to avoid factionalism and
divisive politics, seeing transhumanity’s splintering as
a hindrance to its perpetuation.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to two Technical, Academic: [Field],
    or Profession: [Field] skills; +20 Networking: Scientists
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### BARSOOMIAN

You call the Martian outback and wilds your home. You are a
“redneck,” a lower-class Martian from the rural areas that often
find themselves in conflict with the policies and goals of the
hypercorp domes and Tharsis League.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Freerunning, +10 to one skill of your choice,
    +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:**  Cases, Flats, Rusters, Splicers, Synths

</div>

### BRINKER

You or your faction is reluctant to deal with the rest of the
transhumanity and the various goings-on in the rest of the system. Your
particular grouping may have sought out self-imposed isolation to
pursue their own interests, or they may have been exiled for their
unpopular beliefs. Or you may simply be a loner who prefers the
vast emptiness of space to socializing with others. You might be a
religious cultist, a primitivist, a utopian, or something altogether
uninterested in transhumanity.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Pilot: Spacecraft skill, +10 to a skill of your choice,
    +20 to a Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### CRIMINAL

You are involved with the crime-oriented underworld. You may
work with one of the Sol system’s major criminal factions—triads,
the Night Cartel, the ID Crew, Nine Lives, Pax Familae—or one
of the smaller, local operators with a big stake in a specific habitat.
You might be a vetted member-for-life, a reluctant recruit, or just a
freelancer looking for the next gig.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Intimidation skill, +30 Networking: Criminal skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### EXTROPIAN

You are an anarchistic supporter of the free market and private
property. You oppose government and favor a system where security
and legal matters are handled by private competitors. Whether
you consider yourself an anarcho-capitalist or a mutualist (a
difference only other Extropians can figure out), you occupy a middle
ground between the hypercorps and autonomists, dealing with
both and yet trusted by neither.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Persuasion skill, +20 Networking: Autonomists skill,
    +10 Networking: Hypercorps skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### HYPERCORP

You hail from a habitat controlled by the hypercorps. You might
be a hypercapitalist entrepeneur, a hedonistic socialite, or a lowly
vacworker, but you accept that certain liberties must be sacrifice
for security and freedom.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Protocol skill, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill,
    +10 to any Networking: [Field] skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** Exalts, Olympians, Splicers, Sylphs

</div>

### JOVIAN

Your faction is noted for its authoritarian regime,
bioconservative ideologies, and militaristic tendencies.
Where you come from, technology is not to be trusted
and humans need to be protected from themselves. To
ensure its survival, humanity must be able to defend
itself and unfettered growth must be checked.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to two weapon skills of your choice,
    +10 Fray, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill
- **Disadvantages:** Must start with a Flat or Splicer morph,
    may not start with any nanoware/advanced nanotech
- **Common Morphs:** Flats and Splicers

</div>

### LUNAR

You hail from Luna, the original off-Earth colony
world. Now overpopulated and in decline, Luna is
one of the few places where people still cling to old-Earth
ethnic and national identities. Your home is also
within sight of Earth, a constant reminder that encourages
many “Loonies” to be reclaimers, deploring the
hypercorp interdiction and arguing that you have a
right to return to Earth, terraform it, and re-establish
it as a living homeworld.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to one Language: [Field] of your
    choice, +20 Networking: Hypercorps skill, +10
    Networking: Ecologists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** Cases, Exalts, Flats, Splicers, Synths

</div>

### MERCURIAL

Your faction has no interest in co-opting their true
natures in order to become more “human.” You might
be an AGI that does not necessarily intertwine its
destiny with transhumanity or an uplift that seeks
to preserve and promote non-human life (or at least
your own species). You might even be an infomorph or
posthuman who has strayed so far from transhuman
interests and values that you now consider yourself to
be forging a unique new path of life.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to any two skills of your choice, +20
    to a Networking: [Field] skill of your choice
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** Infomorphs, Synths, uplift morphs

</div>

### SCUM

This is the future we’ve all been waiting for, and
you’re going to enjoy it to the max. A paradigm shift
has occurred, and while everyone else is catching up,
your faction embraces and revels in it. There is no
more want, no more death, no more limits on what
you can be. The scum have immersed themselves in
a new way of life, changing themselves as they see fit
trying out new experiences, and pushing the boundaries
wherever they can … and fuck anyone who can’t
deal with that.

- **Advantages:** +10 Freefall skill, +10 to a skill of your
    choice, +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### SOCIALITE

You are a member of the inner system glitterati, the
media-saturated social cliques that set trends, spread
memes, and make or break lives with whispers, innuendo,
and backroom deals. You are simultaneously an
icon and a devout follower. Culture isn’t just your life,
it’s your weapon of choice.
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 Persuasion skill, +10 Protocol skill,
    +20 Networking: Media skill
- **Disadvantages:** May not start with flat pod, uplift, or

</div>

### TITANIAN

You are a participant in the Titanian Commonwealth’s
socialist cyberdemocracy. Unlike other autonomist projects,
Titanian joint efforts have assembled some impressive
infrastructural projects as approved by the Titanian
Plurality and pursued by state-owned microcorps
<div class="stat-list">

- **Advantages:** +10 to two Technical or Academic skills
    of your choice, +20 Networking: Autonomists skill
- **Disadvantages:** None
- **Common Morphs:** All

</div>

### ULTIMATE

Your faction sees the potential in transhumanity’s
future and looks back upon the rest of transhumanity
as weak and hedonistic. Transhumanity is set to take
the next evolutionary step and it’s time for transhumans
to be redesigned to the best of our capabilities

</div>

### VENUSIAN

You are a supporter of the Morningstar Confederation
of Venusian aerostats, resentful of the growing
influence of the Planetary Consortium and other
entrenched and conservative inner system powers.
You see your faction’s ascension as a chance to reform
the old guard ways of inner system politics.

## SPEND FREE POINTS

Each starting character receives an equal number of
free points for things like rep and aptitudes. These
free points are just the start for building your character,
so don’t fret if you can’t get certain scores as high
as you like. In the next stage of character creation,
you will gain additional points with which you can
customize your character (see
[*Spend Customization Points*](#spend-customization-points)).

<blockquote>

### EXAMPLE: 

Tai is making a character. She decides to create a
salvage retrieval/scavenger type who started as a Lunar
Colonist but is now a Brinker. Together, her background
and faction give Tai +20 Networking: Autonomists skill,
+20 Networking: Hypercorps skill, +10 Pilot: Spacecraft
skill, and +10 Pilot: Groundcraft skill. She also has
+10 to two other skills (one Academic, Professional, or
Technical) that she’ll choose later.

Tai starts with 105 points for aptitudes, which works
out to 15 each. She wants her character to be impulsive
and antisocial, so right away she lowers both SAV and
WIL to 10. She also wants to be smart and fast on her
feet, so takes the extra 10 points that gives her and
raises both COG and REF to 20. So her aptitudes are:

| COG | COO | INT | REF | SAV | SOM | WIL |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 20  | 15  |  15 | 20  |  10 | 15  |  10 |

She marks down her Moxie of 1 and gets her native
language (Chinese) at 85, both for free.

Noting her 5,000 Credits, Tai divides her Rep score
points evenly among @-rep and c-rep, taking 25 in each.

Example continued [here](#example-1)
</blockquote>

### STARTING APTITUDES

Your character receives 105 free points to distribute
among their 7 aptitudes: Cognition, Coordination,
Intuition, Reflexes Savvy, Somatics, and Willpower
(see [*Aptitudes*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes)).
(That breaks down to an average of 15 per aptitude, so it may be easiest to give
each 15 and then adjust accordingly, raising some and
lowering others.) Each aptitude must be given at least
5 points (unless you take the [*Feeble*](./03-traits.md#feeble)) trait, and
no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 (unless you
take the
[*Exceptional Aptitude*](./03-traits.md#exceptional-aptitude-ego-or-morph-trait) trait).
Note that certain morphs (flats and splicers, for example)
may also put a cap on how high you can raise your
aptitudes (see
[*Aptitude Maximums*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitude-maximums)).

For simplicity, it is recommended that aptitude scores
be handled as multiples of 5, but this is not a necessity

### NATIVE TONGUE

Every character receives their natural Language skill
at a rating of 70 + INT for free. This skill may be
raised with CP (see below).

### STARTING MOXIE
Every character starts off with a Moxie stat of 1 (see
[*Moxie*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#moxie)).

### CREDIT

All characters are given 5,000 credits with which
to purchase gear during character creation, unless
you have the Fall Evacuee or Re-instantiated background
(in which case you start with 2,500 or 0 credits, respectively).
See [*Purchase Gear*](#purchase-gear), for more details.

### REP

Your character isn’t a complete newbie. You get 50
rep points to divide between the reputation networks
of your choice (see
[*Reputation and Social Networks*](../09/09-reputation-social-networks.md)).

## SPEND CUSTOMIZATION POINTS

Now that you have the basics of your character
fleshed out, you can spend additional Customization
Points (CP) to fine-tune your character. Each character
is given 1,000 CP, which may be used to increase
aptitudes, buy skills, acquire more Moxie, buy more
credit, elevate your Rep, or purchase positive traits.
You may also take on negative traits in order to get
even more CP with which to customize your character.
This customization process should be used to
tweak your character and specialize them in the ways
you desire.

If a gamemaster seeks a different level of gameplay,
they can adjust this CP amount. If the gamemaster
wants a scenario where the starting characters are
younger or less experienced, they can lower the CP
to 800 or even 700. On the other hand, if you want
to create characters who start off as grizzled veterans,
you can raise the CP to 1,100 or even 1,200.

Not all customizations are equal—aptitudes, for
example, are considerably more valuable than individual
skills. To reflect this, CP must be spent at a
specific ratio according to the specific boost desire.

</div></div>
Trait and morph costs vary as noted.
</blockquote>

### CUSTOMIZING APTITUDES

Raising your aptitude score is quite expensive at 10
CP per aptitude point. As noted above, no aptitude
may be increased above 30. Keep in mind that your
morph may also provide certain aptitude bonuses.

### INCREASING MOXIE
Moxie may be raised at the cost of 15 CP per Moxie
point. The maximum to which Moxie may be raised
is 10.

### LEARNED SKILLS

Each character must purchase a minimum of 400
CP of Active skills and 300 CP of Knowledge skills
(see [*Skills*](../05/00-skills.md)). Skills are bought at the cost of 1 CP
per point. Keep in mind that learned skills start at the
rating of the linked aptitude. For example, if you want
to raise a skill to 30 and the skill’s linked aptitude
is 10, you’ll need to spend 20 CP. Skill bonuses from
background or faction should also be applied to the
rating before you start raising the skill. For simplicity,
it is recommended that skills be purchased as multiples of 5,
but this is not a necessity.

Raising a skill over 60 is expensive. Each point over
60 costs double. Raising a skill with a linked attribute
of 20 up to 70 would cost 60 CP: 40 points to get from
20 to 60, and 20 more points to get from 60 to 70.

No learned skill may be raised over 80 during character
creation (unless you have the [*Expert*](./03-traits.md#expert) trait).

Though Knowledge skills are grouped into 5 skills,
each is a [Field skill](../05/01-skills-overview.md#field-skills),
meaning that it can be taken multiple times with different fields

A complete list of skills can be found in
[*Complete Skill List*](../05/04-complete-skill-list.md).

### SPECIALIZATIONS

[*Specializations*](../05/01-skills-overview.md#specializations),
may also be purchased at the
cost of 5 CP per specialization. You may purchase
specializations for both Active and Knowledge skills. Only
1 specialization may be purchased per skill, and they
may only be bought for skills with a rating of 30+.

### BUYING MORE CREDIT

If you want more cred to spend on gear, every CP will
get you 1,000 credits. See [*Purchase Gear*](#purchase-gear), for
details on buying stuff. The maximum CP you can
spend on additional credits is 100.

### INCREASING REP

If you want your character to start play with lots of
social capital, you can increase your Rep score(s) at the
cost of 1 CP per 10 additional points. No individual
Rep score may be raised above 80, and the maximum
amount of CP that may be spent on Rep is 35 points.

### STARTING MORPH

Perhaps the most important use of CP is to buy the
morph with which your character begins play. This
may be the original bodily form in which your character
started life or it may simply be the sleeve they are
currently inhabiting.

Available morphs are listed starting in [*Starting Morphs*](./02-starting-morphs.md)

Note that any aptitude or skill bonuses provided by
the morph are applied after all CP are spent. In other
words, these bonuses do not affect the costs of buying
aptitude and skill points during character generation.
No aptitude may be modified over 40

### PURCHASING TRAITS

Traits represent specific qualities your character has
that may help or hinder them.

Positive traits supply bonuses in certain situations,
and each has a listed CP cost. You may not spend
more than 50 CP on positive traits.

Negative traits inflict disadvantages on your character,
but they also give you extra CP that you can
spend on customizing your character. You may not
purchase more than 50 CP worth of negative traits,
and no more than 25 CP may be negative morph traits
(no matter how many morphs you buy).

Positive traits are listed in
[*Positive Traits*](./03-traits.md#positive-traits),
negative traits are listed in
[*Negative Traits*](./03-traits.md#negative-traits).
Note that traits you receive from
your background or faction do not cost or provide you
with bonus CP.

Traits listed as morph traits apply to the morph and
not the ego. If the character switches to a new morph,
these traits are lost (and new morph traits may be
gained). Morph traits may be bought like other traits
during character generation.

### PSI SLEIGHTS

Characters who purchase the [Psi](./03-traits.md#psi) trait, may
spend CP to purchase sleights (see
[*Psi-Chi Sleights*](../07/02-psi.md#psi-chi-sleights)).
These represent specific psi abilities the character
has learned. The cost to buy a sleight is 5 CP. No
more than 5 psi-chi and 5 psi-gamma sleights may be
bought during character creation.

Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from
sleights are treated as modifications; they are applied
after all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of
buying skills or aptitudes during character creation.

### EXAMPLE:

Example continued from [here](#example)

Tai now has 1,000 points to customize. She wants to be
lucky, so she starts right off spending 60 (4 × 15) CP to raise
her Moxie from 1 to 5. She also decides that she wants her
character to be better at spotting things, so she raises her
INT from 15 to 20, at a cost of 50 CP (5 × 10). So far, she’s
spent 110 CP.

She must buy at least 400 points of Active skills, so she
tackles that next. She knows that skills are based on aptitudes
and they get more expensive over 60, so she decides
the most she’ll spend on any single skill is 40 (since her
highest aptitude is 20). She picks out her skills, assigns the
points, and adds them to the starting aptitudes.

This is what she starts with, noting the points she
spent on each and the total value (counting aptitude) in
parentheses.

Beam Weapons (COO) 30 (45), Climbing (SOM) 30 (45),
Demolitions (COG) 40 (60), Fray (REF) 30 (50), Freefall (REF)
40 (60), Freerunning (SOM) 30 (45), Hardware: Aerospace
(COG) 40 (60), Infiltration (COO) 30 (45), Interfacing (COG)
20 (40), Navigation (INT) 40 (60), Perception (INT) 40 (60),
Persuasion (SAV) 20 (30), Research (COG) 20 (40), and
Scrounging (INT) 40 (60).

This costs her 450 CP, so she’s spent a total of 560 CP.

Now she spends her 300 points of Knowledge skills:

Academics: Astrophysics (COG) 40 (60), Academics:
Engineering (COG) 40 (60), Academics: Fall History (COG)
40 (60), Art: Sculpture (INT) 40 (60), Interest: Brinker
Stations (COG) 40 (60), Interest: Conspiracies (COG) 30
(50), Language: English (INT) 40 (60), Profession: Appraisal
(COG) 40 (60), Profession: Scavenger Trade (COG) 40 (60).

This costs her another 350 CP, bringing her total spent
CP to 910

Adding in her background and faction skills, she also
has Networking: Autonomists (SAV) 30, Networking:
Hypercorps (SAV) 30, Pilot: Spacecraft (REF) 30 (50), Pilot:
Groundcraft (REF) 30 (50). She takes the freebie +10 and
adds it to Fray (raising it to 60) and applies the other +10
to Academics: Economics (COG) 30.

With 90 CP left, Tai moves on to Rep. Tai wants to have
a lot of good connections, so she raises both of her Rep
scores by 30 points each, at a cost of 6 CP. She also decides
she needs some credibility with criminal types, so she buys
g-rep at 40, for 4 more CP. Now she has 80 CP left.

Tai’s character needs a body, and she decides a bouncer
is most suited for the nomadic, spacefaring lifestyle of her
brinker. That costs another 40 CP, leaving her with 40 CP
left to spend.

Looking back at her skills, she decides to raise her
Pilot: Spacecraft from 50 to 65. It costs her 10 CP to raise
the skill to 60, and another 10 CP to raise it from 60 to
65, for a total cost of 20 CP. She also wants to raise her
Scrounging from 60 to 70, for a 20 CP cost. That nicely uses
up the last of her CP.

Scanning the traits, though, Tai also decides that
Situational Awareness would be a good choice for her
scavenger. At a cost of 10 CP, she would need to take
another negative trait to compensate. She chooses Neural
Damage (synaesthesia)—a condition she inherited from a
rampaging nanovirus during the Fall.

Tai’s points are now all evened out and spent.

## PURCHASE GEAR

No matter what faction you are from, you use Credit
to buy gear during character creation. A complete list
of gear and costs can be found in the [*Gear*](../10/00-gear.md)
chapter. Use the average costs for each cost category
when calculating gear prices. Expensive items with a
minimum listed cost that minimum amount.

Every character starts off with one piece of gear
for free: a [standard muse](../10/13-software.md#standard-muse).
This is the digital AI companion that the character has had since they
were a child. Additionally, each character starts with 1
month of [backup insurance](../10/12-services.md#backup-insurance) at no cost.

There is no limitation other than what the gamemaster
allows on what gear characters can and cannot buy
during character creation. Both the players and gamemaster
should keep the character’s background and
faction in mind. Since some gear is likely very restricted
in some habitats if not outright illegal, there needs to be a
plausible explanation for who and how a character from
such a place might have such gear. If there isn’t, then
the gamemaster can choose not to allow it. The starting
locale for a game should also be considered. A character
from the restrictive Jovian Republic might have a hard
time explaining how they have an illegal cornucopia
machine, but if the game takes place on board a scum
barge where everything is available and anything goes,
then such an explanation becomes much easier.

The one exception to buying gear with Credit is
the purchase of additional morphs. Characters may
buy extra morphs during character creation, but they
must be bought with CP. The player must choose
one morph in which the character is sleeved. Extra
morphs also require [body bank](../10/12-services.md#body-bank) service fees.

Note that any skill or aptitude bonuses from gear
are treated as modifications; they are applied after
all CP are spent and do not affect the cost of buying
skills or aptitudes during character creation.

## CHOOSE MOTIVATIONS

The next step is to choose 3 personal motivations for
your character ([*Motivations*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#motivations)).
These are memes, in the form of ideologies or goals, which your character
is pursuing. These may be as specific as “undermine
the local triad boss” or as broad as “promote
hypercapitalism,” and they may be short term or long
term. Some sample motivations are provided on the
[*Example Motivations*](#example-motivations) table. You
should work with your gamemaster when choosing
your motivations, as they can be used to propel
the storyline forward and specific scenarios can be
constructed around your character’s goals. Some of
your character’s motivations may change later (see
[*Changing Motivation*](./04-character-advancement.md#changing-motivation)).
Motivations will help
your character regain [*Moxie*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#moxie)
and earn extra Rez Points during gameplay (see
[*Awarding Rez Points*](../11/12-gamemastering.md#awarding-rez-points)).

Motivations should be listed on your character
sheet as a single term or short phrase, along with
a + or – symbol to denote whether they support or
oppose it. For example, “+Fame” would indicate that
your character seeks to become a famous media personality,
whereas “–Reclaim Earth” means that your
character opposes the goal of reclaiming Earth.

## FINAL TOUCHES

Now that you have everything settled, there are a few
final steps.

### REMAINING STATS

A few stats now need to be calculated and added to
your character sheet:
- Lucidity, (p. 122) equals your character’s WIL × 2.
- Trauma Threshold, (p. 122) equals your LUC
    divided by 5 (round up).
- Insanity Rating, (p. 122) equals LUC × 2.
- Initiative, (p. 121) equals your character’s
    (REF + INT) ÷ 5.
- Damage Bonus, (p. 122) for melee equals
    SOM ÷ 10 (round down).
- Death Rating, (p. 121) equals DUR × 1.5
    (biomorphs, round up) or DUR × 2 (synthmorphs)
- Speed, (p. 121) equals 1 (3 for infomorphs),
    modified as appropriate by implants


### DETAILING THE CHARACTER

The final step in character creation is filling in the
details and figuring out what your character is
like and what they are all about. Your character’s
Background is a good place to start as it says where
they came, but it could be expanded. What did they
think of their childhood? Do they still have ties from
there? How did they move from such origins to the
Faction they are part of? Are they fully supportive of
their Faction’s goals, or are they in opposition? How
does the character view other Factions?

Next, take a look at the skills and other defining
points—these also tell a story. How did they acquire
those skills? Why? How did they develop their Rep
score (or lack of one)? How did they get connected
with the groupings represented by their Networking
skills? What do the character’s traits say about them?
How did they get their current morph? Is it their
original? If not, what happened to their first body

Also taking into account the major factor of
Motivations, all of these questions will help you build
a defining picture of your character. Not everything
about your character needs to be filled out, of course—it’s
ok to leave a few blanks that you can fill in later.
Assembling the points you have deduced so far will
help you to present your character as a whole, unique
individual, however, rather than just a blank template.

As a final step, take a few minutes to pick out some
specific identifying features and personality quirks that
will help you define the character to others. This could
be a way of talking, a strongly projected attitude, a
catchphrase they use frequently, a unique look or style
of dress, a repetitive behavior, an annoying mannerism,
or anything else similar that is easy to latch onto. Such
idiosyncrasies give something that other players can
latch onto, spurring roleplaying opportunities.
