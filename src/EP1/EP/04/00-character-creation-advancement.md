The first step towards playing *Eclipse Phase* is to
define your character. If you’re new to the game and
setting, the easiest way to jump right in is to simply
select one of the [Sample Characters](./05-sample-characters.md) provided.
If you’re more familiar with RPGs, or
you simply want finer control over your character,
you can build them from scratch, perhaps using one
of the Sample Characters as a template. This chapter
will walk you through the process of character generation,
from the general concept and personality to the
crunchy game statistics.
