# CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT

As characters accomplish goals and gather experience
during gameplay, they accumulate Rez Points (see
[*Awarding Rez Points*](../11/12-gamemastering.md#awarding-rez-points)).
Rez Points may be used
to improve the character’s skills, aptitudes, and other
characteristics per the following rules. The costs for
spending Rez Points for advancement are the same as
the costs for spending Customization Points.

## CHANGING MOTIVATION

Itis only natural that over time a character’s driving
goals and interests will change. The character may
reach a turning point where they feel certain personal
agendas have been fulfilled and it is time to move on,
or they have failed and need to be discarded. New
urgencies or philosophies may have entered the
character’s life, or the character may have become
disenchanted with particular memes and ideas they
previously took to heart.

Changing a character’s motivation does not cost
Rez Points, but it is something that should only
happen in accordance with roleplaying and with
life-altering events. Players should not be allowed
to simply switch their motivations at whim, there
should be a driving reason or explanation for doing
so. For this reason, changing a motivation should only
happen when the player and gamemaster discuss the
matter and both agree that the swap is appropriate to
the character’s development and circumstances.

If these conditions are met, the character simply
drops a previously held motivation and takes on a
new one. Only one motivation should be switched
out at a time.

## SWITCHING MORPHS

Resleeving—switching from one morph to another—is
handled as an in-character interaction, not with Rez
Points. see
[*Resleeving*](../09/02-resleeving.md).

## IMPROVING APTITUDES

Aptitudes may be raised with Rez Points at the cost of
10 RP per aptitude point. This represents the character’s
improvement in their core characteristics, gained from
exercise, learning, and experience. Aptitudes may not
be raised above 30 (bonuses from morphs, implants,
traits, or other sources do not count towards this total).

Raising the value of an aptitude also raises the
value of all linked skills by an equivalent amount. If
this raises any linked skills over 60, an additional
1 RP must be spent per linked skill over 60 (with the
exception of the character’s native language skill and
skills capped at 99).

## IMPROVING SKILLS

Characters may also spend Rez Points to increase
existing skills or learn new ones. To improve an existing
skill, the character must have successfully used that
skill in the recent past or must actively practice it in
order to get better, perhaps with the aid of an instructor.
In the case of Knowledge skills, this means actively
studying. As a rough timeframe, this should require
around 1 week of learning per skill point. A number
of educational resources are freely available via the
mesh, though some areas of interest may be restricted
or hard to find This can be handled via
roleplaying or designated as something the
character is doing during downtime between
sessions. If the gamemaster decides that a
character has not put enough effort into
improving a skill, they may call for more
practice/study.

The cost to increase a skill is 1 RP per skill
point, and no skill may be increased over 99.
No skill may be raised by more than 5 points
per month. When a character’s skill reaches
the level of expertise (skill of 60+), however,
they tend to reach a plateau where improvement
progresses more slowly and even consistent
practice and study have diminished
returns. In this case, the Rez Point cost per
skill point doubles (i.e., 2 RP = +1 skill point).
When a skill reaches 80, improvement slows
down even further—a skill of 80+ may not
be increased by more than 1 point per month.

### LEARNING NEW SKILLS

Similarly, to learn a new skill, the character
must actively study/practice and/or seek
instruction. No test to learn is required,
unless the period of study was hampered
or in some way deficient in which case the
gamemaster may call for a COG × 3 Test
to pick up the new skill. Otherwise, once a
character has spent approximately a week
learning a new skill, they may purchase their
first skill point at the usual cost (1 RP). The
skill is bought up from the aptitude rating,
per normal. Once a new skill is acquired, it is
raised according to the standard rules above.

## SPECIALIZATIONS

Specializations may be purchased for existing
skills, as long as that skill is at least
rating 30. Specializations require a total
of 1 month of training. The cost to learn a
specialization is 5 RP. Only 1 specialization
may be purchased per skill.

## IMPROVING MOXIE

Moxie may be raised at the cost of 15 RP per
Moxie point. The maximum to which Moxie
may be raised is 10.

## GAINING/LOSING TRAITS

At the gamemaster’s discretion, both positive
and negative traits may be acquired or lost
during gameplay, though such changes should
be rare and only made in accordance with the
storyline and unfolding events in the game.

Both positive and negative traits may be
picked up by a character during gameplay
as a consequence of something that did or
something that happened to them. In the
case of a positive trait, the character must
immediately spend Rez Points equal to the
trait’s CP cost for the privilege (whether they
wanted the new trait or not). If the character
has no unspent RP available, they must pay
out immediately from any future RP they
earn until the debt is paid off. In the case
of a negative trait, however, the character is
simply saddled with the new flaw—they do
not acquire any extra RP for gaining the
negative trait.

Getting rid of traits is somewhat more difficult
Positive traits may be lost due to unfortunate
effects on the character, as the gamemaster
sees fit Such lost positive traits are
simply gone—the character does not receive
any Rez Point reimbursement. Negative traits
are occasionally eliminated in the same way,
but more typically they can only be worked
off through the hard work and diligence of a
character that seeks to overcome their handicap.
Such endeavors should require weeks if
not months of effort on the character’s part,
with appropriate roleplaying and possibly
some difficult tests. In fact, overcoming such
traits could be the source of an adventure.
Once a gamemaster feels that the character
has made a strong-enough effort, the character
may pay a number of Rez Points equal
to the trait’s original CP bonus to negate it.
Note, however, that some negative traits may
simply not be discarded, no matter what the
character does.

## IMPROVING REP

Reputation is something that can be
increased with appropriate roleplaying and
actions during gameplay (see Reputation
[*Gain and Loss*](../11/12-gamemastering.md#reputation-gain-and-loss)).
Characters that prefer to handle their Rep-boosting activities
“offscreen,” however, can simply spend Rez
Points to boost their score(s). Each RP spent
boosts the character’s Rep by +10 in a single
network. Only one such boost may be made
to a single rep network per month.

## MAKING CREDIT

Rez Points may be spent on Credit at a ratio
of 1 RP for 1,000 Credits. This represents
income the character has earned “offscreen”
or during downtime, such as from odd jobs,
selling off possessions, and so on.

## IMPROVING PSI

Characters who have the [Psi](./03-traits.md#psi) trait
may purchase new sleights (see
[*Psi-Chi Sleights*](../07/02-psi.md#psi-chi-sleights))
at the cost of 5 RP per
sleight. Sleights must be learned through
study, training, and practice, requiring
approximately 1 month per sleight. No more
than one sleight may be learned per month.
