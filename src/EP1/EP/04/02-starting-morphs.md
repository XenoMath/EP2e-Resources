# STARTING MORPHS

Each morph has an associated CP cost. It also supplies
the character’s Durability and Wound Threshold stats
and may modify Initiative, Speed, and certain aptitudes
and learned skills. A credit cost is also listed, but this
refers to the cost of buying such a morph in gameplay.

**Flexible Aptitude Bonuses:** Some morphs have aptitude
bonuses that may be applied to an aptitude of the
player’s choice. This reflects that not all morphs are
created equal. When assigning these universal aptitude
bonuses, each boost must be applied to a separate
aptitude; you may not elevate an aptitude that is already
raised by that morph. Once an individual morph’s
aptitude bonuses have been assigned, they are permanent
for that morph (i.e., if another character resleeves
into that morph, the bonuses remain the same).

## BIOMORPHS

Biomorphs are fully biological sleeves (usually
equipped with implants), birthed naturally or in an
exowomb, and grown to adulthood either naturally
or at a slightly accelerated rate.

### FLATS

Flats are baseline unmodified humans, born with all
of the natural defects, hereditary diseases, and other
genetic mutations that evolution so lovingly applies.
Flats are increasingly rare—most died off with the rest
of humanity during the Fall. Most new children are
splicers—screened and genefixed at the least—except
in habitats where flats are treated as second-class citizens
and indentured labor.

</div>


### MENTONS

Mentons are genetically modified to increase cognitive
abilities, particularly learning ability, creativity,
attentiveness, and memory. Rumors exist of super-enhanced
mentons with more extreme intelligence mods, but brain-hacking
is notoriously difficult and many attempts to redesign mental
faculties result in impaired functioning, instability, or insanity.

upgrades feature genetics tailored for endurance,
strength, and reflexes, as well as behavioral
modifications for aggressiveness and cunning. To
offset tendencies for unruliness and macho behavior
patterns, furies feature gene sequences promoting
pack mentalities and cooperation, and they tend to
be biologically female.

### FUTURAS

An exalt variant, futura morphs were specially crafted
for the “Lost generation.” Tailor-made for accelerated
growth and adjusted for confidence self-reliance, and
adaptability, futuras were intended to help transhumanity
regain its foothold. These programs proved
disastrous and the line was discontinued, but some
models remain, viewed by some with distaste and
others as collectibles or exotic oddities.

### HIBERNOIDS

Hibernoids are transgenic-modified humans with
heavily altered sleep patterns and metabolic processes.
Hibernoids have a decreased need for sleep, requiring
only 1–2 hours a day on average. They also have
the ability to trigger a form of voluntary hibernation,
effectively stopping their metabolism and need for
oxygen. Hibernoids make excellent long-duration
space travelers and habtechs, but these morphs are
also favored by personal aides and hypercapitalists
with non-stop lifestyles.

### NEOTENICS

Neotenics are transhumans modified to retain a childlike
form. They are smaller, more agile, inquisitive,
and less resource-depleting, making them ideal for
habitat living and spacecraft. Some people find neotenic
sleeves distasteful, especially when employed in
certain media and sex work capacities.

</div>

### REMADE

The remade are completely redesigned humans: humans
2.0. Their cardiovascular systems are stronger, the
digestive tract has been sanitized and restructured to
eliminate flaws and they have otherwise been optimized
for good health, smarts, and longevity with numerous
transgenic mods. The remade are popular with the ultimates
faction. The remade look close to human, but are
different in very noticeable and sometimes eerie ways:
taller, lack of hair, slightly larger craniums, wider eyes,
smaller noses, smaller teeth, and elongated digits.

### NEO-AVIANS

Neo-avians include ravens, crows, and gray parrots
uplifted to human-level intelligence. Their physical sizes
are much larger than their non-uplifted cousins (to
the size of a human child), with larger heads for their
increased brain size. Numerous transgenic modifications
have been made to their wings, allowing them to
retain limited flight capabilities at 1 g, but giving them
a more bat-like physiology so they can bend and fold
better and adding primitive digits for basic tool manipulation.
Their toes are also more articulated and now
accompanied with an opposable thumb. Neo-avians
have adapted well to microgravity environments, and
are favored for their small size and reduced resource use.

### OCTOMORPHS

These uplifted octopi sleeves have proven quite useful
in zero-gravity environments. They retain eight arms,
their chameleon ability to change skin color, ink sacs,
and a sharp beak. They also have increased brain mass
and longevity, can breathe both air and water, and lack
a skeletal structure so they can squeeze
through tight spaces. Octomorphs typically
crawl along in zero gravity using their
arm suckers and expelling air for propulsion and
can even walk on two of their arms in low gravity.
Their eyes have been enhanced with color vision,
provide a 360-degree field of vision, and rotationally
adjust to keep the slit-shaped pupil aligned with “up.”
A transgenic vocal system allows them to speak.

</div>

## PODS

Pods (from “pod people”) are vat-grown, biological
bodies with extremely undeveloped brains that are augmented
with an implanted computer and cybernetics
system. Though typically run by an AI, pods are socially
unfavored in some stations, used as slave labor in others,
and even illegal in some areas. Because pods underwent
accelerated growth in their creation and were mostly
grown as separate parts and then assembled, their biological
design includes some shortcuts and limitations,
offset with implants and regular maintenance. They lack
reproductive capabilities. In many habitats, their legal
status is a hotly contested issue.

Unless otherwise noted, pods are also considered biomorphs
for all rules purposes.

### PLEASURE PODS

Pleasure pods are exactly what they seem—faux
humans designed purely for intimate
entertainment purposes. Pleasure pods have extra
nerve clusters in their erogenous zones, fine motor
control over certain muscle groups, enhanced pheromones,
sanitized metabolisms, and the genetics for
purring. Naturally, they are crafted for good looks
and charisma and enhanced in other areas as well.
Pleasure pods are capable of switching their sex at
will to male, female, hermaphrodite, neuter, or other
intersex variations.

### NOVACRAB

Novacrabs are a pod design bioengineered from
coconut crab and spider crab stock and grown to a
larger (human) size. Novacrabs are ideal for hazardous
work environments as well as vacworker, police,
or bodyguard duties, given their ten 2-meter long legs,
massive claws, and chitinous armor. They climb and
handle microgravity well and can withstand a wide
range of atmospheric pressure (and sudden pressure
changes) from vacuum to deep sea. Novacrabs feature
compound eyes (with human-equivalent image resolution),
gills, dexterous manipulatory digits on their fift
set of limbs, and transgenic vocal cords.

</div>

## SYNTHETIC MORPHS

Synthetic morphs are completely artificial/robotic. They
are usually operated by AIs or via remote control, but
the lack of available biomorphs after the Fall meant
that many infugees resorted to resleeving in robotic
shells, which were also cheaper, quicker to manufacture,
and more widely available. Nevertheless, synthmorphs
are viewed with disdain in many habitats, an option
that only the poor and desperate accept to be sleeved
in. Synthetic morphs are not without their advantages,
however, and so are commonly used for menial labor,
heavy labor, habitat construction, and security services.

All synthmorphs have the following advantages:
- **Lack of Biological Functions.** Synthmorphs need
    not be bothered with trivialities like breathing,
    eating, defecating, aging, sleeping, or any similar
    minor but crucial aspects of biological life.
- **Pain Filter.** Synthmorphs can filter out their
    pain receptors so that they are unhampered by
    wounds or physical damage. This allows them
    to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound (see
    [*Wound Effects*](../06/07-physical-health.md#wound-effects)),
    but they suffer –30 on any tactile-based Perception Tests
    and will not even notice they have been damaged unless they
    succeed in a (modified) Perception Test.
- **Immunity to Shock Weapons.** Synthmorphs have
    no nervous system to disrupt, and their optical
    electronics are carefully shielded from interference.
    Shock attacks may temporarily disrupt their
    wireless radio communications, however, for the
    duration of the attack.
- **Environmental Durability.** Synthmorphs are
    built to withstand a wide range of environments,
    from dusty Mars to the oceans of Europa to the
    vacuum of space. They are unaffected by any but
    the most extreme temperatures and atmospheric
    pressures. Treat as
    [temperature tolerance](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#temperature-tolerance)
    and [vacuum sealing](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#vacuum-sealing).
- **Toughness.** Synthetic shells are made to last—a
    fact reflected in their higher Durability and built-in
    Armor ratings. Their composition also makes
    their physical strikes more damaging: apply a +2
    DV modifier on unarmed attacks for human-sized
    shells and larger.


### CASE

Cases are extremely cheap, mass-produced robotic
shells intended to provide an affordable remorphing
option for the millions of infugees created by the Fall.
Though many varieties of case shells exist, they are
uniformly regarded as shoddy and inferior. Most case
morphs are vaguely anthropomorphic, with a thin
framework body standing just shorter than an average
human. They suffer from frequent malfunctions.

### SYNTH

Synths are anthropomorphic robotic shells (androids
and gynoids). They are typically used for menial
labor jobs where pods are not as good of an option.
Cheaper than many other morphs, they are commonly
used for people who need a body quickly and
cheaply or simply on a transient basis. Though they
look humanoid, synths are easily recognizable as
non-biological unless they have the
[synthetic mask](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#synthetic-mask)

### ARACHNOIDS

Arachnoid robotic shells are 1-meter in length, segmented
into two parts, with a smaller head like a
spider or termite. They feature four pairs of 1.5-meter-long
retractable arms/legs, capable of rotating around
the axis of the body, with built-in pneumatic systems
for propelling the bot with small leaps. The manipulator
claws on each arm/leg can be switched out with
extendable mini-wheels for high-speed skating movement.
A smaller pair of manipulator arms near the
head allows for closer handling and tool use. In zero-g
environments, arachnoids can retract their arms/legs
and maneuver with vectored air thrusters.

### FLEXBOTS

Designed for multipurpose functions, flexbots can
transform their shells to suit a range of situations
and tasks. Their core frame consists of a half-dozen
interlocking and shape-adjustable modules capable
of auto-transforming into a variety of shapes: multi-legged
walker, tentacle, hovercraft, and many others.
Each module features its own sensor units and “bush
robot” fractal-branching digits (capable of breaking
into smaller digits, down to the micrometer scale,
allowing for ultra-fine manipulation). The flexbo
control computer is also distributed between modules.
Individual flexbots are only the size of a large dog, but
multiple flexbots can join together for larger mass
operations, even taking on heavy-duty tasks such
as demolition, excavation, manufacturing, robotics
assembly, and so on.

### REAPER

The reaper is a common combat bot, used in place of
biomorph soldiers and typically operated via teleoperation
or by autonomous AI. The reaper’s core form
is an armored disc, so that it can turn and present a
thin profile to an enemy. It uses vector-thrust nozzles
to maneuver in microgravity and also takes advan-
tage of an ionic drive for fast movement over distance.
Four legs/manipulating arms and four weapon pods
are folded inside its frame. The reaper’s shell is made
of smart materials, allowing these limbs and weapon
mounts to extrude in any direction desired and even
to change shape and length. In gravity environments,
the reaper walks or hops on two or four of these limbs.
Reapers are infamous due to numerous war XPs, and
bringing one into most habitats will undoubtedly raise
eyebrows if not get you arrested.

### SLITHEROIDS

Slitheroid bots are synthetic shells taking the form of
a 2-meter-long segmented metallic snake, with two
retractable arms for tool use. Snake bots can coil,
twist, and roll their bodies into a ball or hoop, moving
either by slithering, burrowing, rolling, or pulling
themselves along by their arms. The sensor suite and
control computer are housed in the head.

### SWARMANOID

The swarmanoid is not a single shell per se, but rather
a swarm of hundreds of insect-sized robotic micro-drones.
Each individual “bug” is capable of crawling,
rolling, hopping several meters, or using nanocopter
fan blades for airlift. The controlling computer,
cortical stack, and sensor systems are distributed
throughout the swarm. Though the swarm can “meld”

is incapable of tackling physical tasks like grabbing,
lifting, or holding as a unit. Individual bugs are quite
capable of interfacing with electronics.

### INFOMORPHS

Infomorphs are digital-only forms—they lack a physical
body. Infomorphs are sometimes carried by other
characters instead of (or in addition to) a muse in a
[ghostrider module](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#ghostrider-module).
Full rules for infomorphs can be found in
[*AGIs and Infomorphs*](../08/18-agis-infomorphs.md).
