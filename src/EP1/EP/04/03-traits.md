# TRAITS

Unless otherwise noted, listed traits are ego traits.

## POSITIVE TRAITS



<div class="stat-list">

### ADAPTABILITY

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

Resleeving is a breeze for this character. They adjust
to new morphs much more quickly than most other
people. Apply a +10 modifier per level for
[*Integration Tests*](../09/02-resleeving.md#integration) and
[*Alienation Tests*](../09/02-resleeving.md#alienation).




<div class="stat-list">

### ALLIES

- **Cost:** 30 CP

</div>

The character is part of or has a relationship
with some influential group that they can occasionally
call on for support. For example, this could
be their old gatecrashing crew, former research lab
co-workers, a criminal cartel they are part of, or
an elite social clique. The gamemaster and player
should work out what the character’s relationship
is with this group, and why the character can call
on them for aid. Gamemaster’s should take care
that these allies are not abused, such as calling
on them more than once per game session. The
character’s ties to this group are also a two-way
street—they will be expected to perform duties for
the group on occasion as well (a potential plot seed
for scenarios).

<div class="stat-list">

### AMBIDEXTROUS

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character can use and manipulate objects
equally well with both hands (they do not suffer the
off-hand modifie , as noted under
[*Wielding Two or More Weapons*](../06/06-action-combat-complications.md#wielding-two-or-more-weapons)).
If the character has other
prehensile limbs (feet, tail, tentacles, etc.), this trait
may be applied to a limb other than the hand. This
trait may be taken multiple times for multiple limbs.

<div class="stat-list">

### ANIMAL EMPATHY

- **Cost:** 5 CP

</div>

The character has an instinctive feel for handling
and working with non-sapient animals of all kinds.
Apply a +10 modifier to Animal Handling skill tests
or whenever the character makes a test to influence or
interact with an animal.

<div class="stat-list">

### BRAVE

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

This character does not scare easily and will
face threats, intimidation, and certain bodily harm
without flinching As a side effect, the character is
not always the best at gauging risks, especially when
it comes to factoring in danger to others. The character
receives a +10 modifier on all tests to resist
fear or intimidation.

<div class="stat-list">

### COMMON SENSE

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character has an innate sense of judgment that
cuts through other distractions and factors that might
cloud a decision. Once per game session, the player
may ask the gamemaster what choice they should
make or what course of action they should take, and
the gamemaster should give them solid advice based
on what the character knows. Alternatively, if the
character is about to make a disastrous decision, the
gamemaster can use the character’s free hint and warn
the player they are making a mistake.


<div class="stat-list">

### DANGER SENSE

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character has an intuitive sixth sense that
warns them of imminent threats. They receive a +10
modifier on [*Surprise Tests*](../06/06-action-combat-complications.md#surprise).

<div class="stat-list">

### DIRECTION SENSE

- **Cost:** 5 CP

</div>

Somehow the character always knows which way
is up, north, etc., even when blinded. The character
receives a +10 modifier for figuring out complex
directions, reading maps, and remembering or retracing
a path they have taken.

<div class="stat-list">

### EIDETIC MEMORY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

Much like a computer, the character has perfect
memory recall. They can remember anything they have
sensed, often even from a single glance. This works the
same as the [eidetic memory](../10/03-personal-augmentation.md#eidetic-memory)
implant.

<div class="stat-list">

### EXCEPTIONAL APTITUDE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 20 CP

</div>

As an ego trait, the character may raise the
maximum for a particular chosen aptitude to 40 rather
than 30 ([*Aptitudes*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitudes)).
As a morph trait, it raises the morph
aptitude maximum
([*Aptitude Maximums*](../03/04-defining-your-character.md#aptitude-maximums))
for a particular chosen
aptitude by 10 (30 for flats 35 for splicers, 40 for all
others). Note that this trait just raises the maximum,
it does not give the character 10 more aptitude points.
This trait may only be taken by a morph or ego once.


<div class="stat-list">

### EXPERT

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character is a legend in the use of one particular
skill. The character may raise one learned skill over 80,
to a maximum of 90, during character creation. This
trait does not actually increase the skill, it just raises
the maximum. This trait may only be taken once.

<div class="stat-list">

### FAST LEARNER

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character improves skills and learns new ones
in half the time it normally takes (see
[*Improving Skills*](./04-character-advancement.md#improving-skills)).

<div class="stat-list">

### FIRST IMPRESSION

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character has a way of charming or otherwise
making a good impression the first time they interact
with someone. This innate social lubricant allows them
to more readily deal with new contacts and slip right
into new social environments. Apply a +10 modifier
on social skill tests when the character is interacting
with another character for the first time only.

<div class="stat-list">

### HYPER LINGUIST

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character has an intuitive understanding of
linguistic structures that facilitates learning new
languages easily. The character requires one-third the
normal amount of time to learn any language (see
[*Improving Skills*](./04-character-advancement.md#improving-skills)).
The character can also learn
any human language in one day simply by constant
immersive exposure to it. Additionally, the character
receives a +10 modifier when attempting to interpret
languages they don’t know.

<div class="stat-list">

### IMPROVED IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

The morph’s immune system is robust and more
resistant to diseases, drugs, and toxins—even more
than basic biomods. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifie
whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects
of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to
+20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### INNOCUOUS (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

In an age when exotic appearances and good looks
are commonplace, the morph’s look is surprisingly
bland and undistinguished, in that cookie cutter sort of
way. The character’s physical looks are so mundane that
others have a hard time picking them out of a crowd,
describing their appearance, or otherwise remembering
physical details. Apply a –10 modifier to all tests made
to spot, describe, or remember the character. This modifier
does not apply to psi or mesh searches


<div class="stat-list">

### LIMBER (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

The morph is especially flexible and supple, capable of
graceful contortions and interesting positions. At Level
1, the character can smoke with their toes, do the splits,
and squeeze into small, cramped spaces. At Level 2, they
are double-jointed escape artists. Each level provides a
+10 modifier to escaping from bonds, fitting into narrow
confines, and other acts relying on contortion or flexibility.
This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### MATH WIZ

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character can perform any feat of calculation,
including the most complex and advanced mathematics,
instantly and with great precision, with the same
ease an unmodified human can add 2 + 3. The character
can calculate odds, find correlations in numerical
data, and perform similar tasks with great ease. Apply
a +30 modifier on tests involving math calculations

<div class="stat-list">

### NATURAL IMMUNITY (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The morph has a natural immunity to a specific
drug, disease, or toxin. When afflicted with that
specific chemical, poison, or pathogen, the character
remains unaffected. This immunity may not be
applied to nanodrugs or nanotoxins and at the gamemaster’s
discretion may not be applied to other specific
agents This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

The character has a high threshold for pain tolerance
and is better at ignoring the effects of pain on
their abilities and concentration. Level 1 allows them
to ignore the –10 modifier from 1 wound. Level 2
allows them to ignore the –10 modifiers from 2
wounds. This trait is only available for biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### PATRON

- **Cost:** 30 CP

</div>

The character has an influential person in their
life who can be relied on for occasional support.
This could be a wealthy hyperelite family member, a
high-ranking triad boss, or an anarchist networker
with an unbeatable reputation. When called upon,
this patron can pull strings on the character’s behalf,
supply resources, introduce them to people they need
to know, and bail them out of trouble. The player
and gamemaster should work together to define
exactly who this NPC is and what their relationship
with the player character is. Specificall , the question
of why this patron is supporting the character should
be answered (familial obligation? childhood buddies?
the character saved their life once?). Gamemasters
should be careful that this trait does not get abused.
The patron should be an occasional help (probably
no more than once per game session at most) but is
not always at the character’s beck-and-call. If the
character asks for too much, too often, they should
find the patron’s support drying up. Additionally, the
character may need to take action to maintain the
relationship, such as undertaking a mission on the
patron’s behalf. In fact, the character may only have
their patronage because they are on-call or of use to
the NPC in some way.

<div class="stat-list">

### PSI

- **Cost:** 20 CP (Level 1), 25 CP (Level 2)

</div>

The character has been infected with the Watts-MacLeod
strain of the exsurgent virus, which altered
their brain structure and opened the potential for their
mind to enhance their cognitive abilities and read and
manipulate the biological minds of others (see
[*Psi*](../07/02-psi.md)).
The character may purchase and learn psi sleights (see
[*Psi-Chi Sleights*](../07/02-psi.md#psi-chi-sleights)).
At Level 1, the character may
only use psi-chi sleights. At Level 2, the character may
use both psi-chi and psi-gamma sleights.

Though this trait is not very expensive, gamemasters
should not allow it to be abused. There are a
number of negative side effects to Watts-MacLeod
infection, noted under
[*Psi Drawbacks*](../07/02-psi.md#psi-drawbacks).

<div class="stat-list">

### PSI CHAMELEON (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character’s mental state is naturally resistant to
psi sensing. Apply a –10 modifier to any attempts to
locate or detect the character via psi sleights.

<div class="stat-list">

### PSI DEFENSE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

The character’s mind is inherently resistant to
mental attacks. At Level 1, apply a +10 modifier to
all defense tests made against psi attacks. At Level 2,
apply a +20 modifie .

<div class="stat-list">

### RAPID HEALER (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The morph recovers from damage more quickly.
Reduce the timeframes for healing by half, as noted
on the
[Healing table](../06/08-healing-repair.md#healing).
This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### RIGHT AT HOME

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character chooses one type of morph (splicer,
neo-hominid, case, etc.). The character always feels
right at home in morphs of this type. When resleeving
into this type of morph, the character automatically
adjusts to the new body, no Integration or
Alienation Test needed, suffering no penalties and
no mental stress.

<div class="stat-list">

### SECOND SKIN

- **Cost:** 15 CP

</div>

If your character background or faction enforces
a restriction on your starting morph (for example,
uplifts must start with an uplift morph), this trait
allows you to ignore that restriction and purchase a
starting morph of your choice.


<div class="stat-list">

### SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character is very good at maintaining continuous
partial awareness of the goings-on in their
immediate environment. In game terms, they do not
suffer the Distracted modifier on Perception Tests
to notice things even when their attention is focused
elsewhere or when making Quick Perception Tests
during combat.

<div class="stat-list">

### STRIKING LOOKS (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

In an age where biosculpting is easy, good looks are
both cheap and commonplace. This morph, however,
possesses a physical look that can only be described as
striking and unusual, but also somehow alluring and
fascinating—even the gorgeous and chiseled glitterati
take notice. On social skill tests where the character’s
beauty may affect the outcome, they receive a +10 (for
Level 1) or +20 (for Level 2) modifie . This modifie
is ineffective against xenomorphs or those with the
infolife or uplift backgrounds. This trait is only
available to biomorphs.

This modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs,
but at half the cost, and it is only effective against
characters with that specific uplift background (i.e.,
neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

The one drawback to this trait is that the character
is more easily noticed and remembered.

<div class="stat-list">

### TOUGH (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP

</div>

This morph is resilient than others of its type
and can take more physical abuse. Increase their
Durability by +5 per level (+5 at Level 1, +10 at
Level 2, and +15 at Level 3). This also increases
Wound Threshold by +1, +2, and +3 respectively.

<div class="stat-list">

### ZOOSEMIOTICS

- **Cost:** 5

</div>

A character with this trait and the Psi trait does
not suffer a modifier when using psi sleights on non-sapient
or partly sapient animal species.


## NEGATIVE TRAITS

Negative traits generally hinder the character and
apply negative modifiers in certain circumstances.

<div class="stat-list">

### ADDICTION (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:**: 5 CP (Minor), 10 CP (Moderate), or 20 CP (Major)

</div>

Addiction comes in two forms: mental (affecting
the ego) and physical (affecting the biomorph). The
character or morph is addicted to a
[drug](../10/07-drugs-chemicals-toxins.md),
stimulus (XP), or activity (mesh use) to a degree that
impacts the character’s physical or mental health.
Players and gamemasters should work together to
agree on addictions that are appropriate for their
game. Addiction comes in three levels of severity:
minor, moderate, or major:

**Minor:** A minor addiction is largely kept under
control—it does not ruin the character’s life, though
it may create some difficulties The character may not
even recognize or admit they have a problem. The
character must indulge the addiction at least once
a week, though they can go for longer without too
much difficult . If they fail to get their weekly dose,
they suffer a –10 modifier on all actions until they get
their fix

**Moderate:** A moderate addiction is in full swing.
The character obviously has a problem, and must
satisfy the addiction at least once a day. If they fail
to do so, they may suffer mood swings, compulsive
behavior, physical sickness, or other side effects until
they indulge their craving. Apply a –20 modifie to
all of the character’s actions until they get their fix
Additionally, a character with this level of addiction
suffers a penalty of –5 DUR (physical addiction) or
–10 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental addiction).

**Major:** A character with a major addiction is on
the rapid road to ruin. They face cravings every 6
hours and suffer a penalty of –10 DUR (physical
addiction) or –20 to Willpower Stress Tests (mental
addiction). If they fail to get their regular dosage,
they suffer a –30 modifier on all actions until they
do. If their life hasn’t already been ruined by their
obsession, it soon will be.

<div class="stat-list">

### AGED (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The morph is physically aged and has not been
rejuvenated. Old morphs are increasingly uncommon,
though some people adopt them hoping to gain an air
of seniority and respectability. Reduce the character’s
aptitude maximums by 5, and apply a –10 modifie
on all physical actions.

This trait may only be applied to flat and splicer
morphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### BAD LUCK

- **Cost:** 30 CP

</div>

Due to some inexplicable cosmic coincidence,
things seem to go wrong around the character. The
gamemaster is given a pool of Moxie points equal
to the character’s Moxie stat, which also refreshes
at the same rate as the character’s Moxie. Only the
gamemaster may utilize this Moxie, however, and
the purpose is to use it *against* the character. In other
words, the gamemaster can use this bad Moxie to
cause the character to automatically fail, flip-flo a
roll, and so on. To reflect the black cloud that follows
the character, the gamemaster can even use this
bad Moxie against the character’s friends and allies,
when they are doing something with or related to
the character, though this should be used sparingly.
Gamemasters who might be reluctant to sabotage the
character should remember that the player asked for
it by purchasing this trait.

<div class="stat-list">

### BLACKLISTED

- **Cost:** 5 or 20 CP

</div>

The character has managed to get themselves
blacklisted in certain circles, whether they actually
did something to deserve it or not. In game terms, the
character is barred from having a Rep score higher
than 0 in one particular reputation network. People
within that network will refuse to help the character
out of fear of reprisals and ruining their own reputa-
tion. The bonus for this trait is 20 CP if chosen for the
rep network pertaining to the character’s own starting
faction, and 5 CP if chosen for any other.

<div class="stat-list">

### BLACK MARK

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP

</div>

At some point in the character’s past, they managed
to do something that earned a black mark on their
reputation. For some reason, no matter what they do,
this black mark cannot be shaken off and continues to
haunt their interactions. In game terms, the character
picks one faction. Every time they interact with this
faction (such as a Networking Test) or with an NPC
from this faction (Social Skill Tests) who knows the
character, they suffer a –10 modifier per level

<div class="stat-list">

### COMBAT PARALYSIS

- **Cost:** 20 CP

</div>

The character has an unfortunate habit of freezing
in combat or stressful situations, like a deer caught in
headlights. Anytime violence breaks out around the
character or they are surprised, the character must
make a Willpower Test in order to act or respond in
any way. If they fail the test, they lose their action and
simply stand there, remaining incapable of reacting to
the situation.

<div class="stat-list">

### EDITED MEMORIES

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

At some point in the character’s past, the character
had certain memories strategically removed or
otherwise lost to them. This may have been done to
intentionally forget an unpleasant or shameful experience
or to make a break with the past. The memory
may also have been lost by an unexpected death (with
no recent backup), or it may have been erased against
the character’s will. Whatever the case, the memory
should bear some importance, and there should exist
either evidence of what happened or NPCs who know
the full story. This is a tool the gamemaster can use to
haunt the character at some future point with ghosts
from their past.

<div class="stat-list">

### ENEMY

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

At some point in their past, the character made
an enemy for life who continues to haunt them. The
gamemaster and player should work out the details on
this enmity, and the gamemaster should use the enemy
as an occasional threat, surprise, and hindrance.

<div class="stat-list">

### FEEBLE

- **Cost:** 20 CP

</div>

The character is particularly weak with one apti-
tude. That aptitude must be purchased at a rating
lower than 5 and may never be upgraded during char-
acter advancement. The aptitude maximum is 10, no
matter what morph the character is wearing.

<div class="stat-list">

### FRAIL (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

This morph is not as resilient as others of its type.
Its Durability is reduced by 5 per level. This also
reduces Wound Threshold by 1 or 2, respectively.

<div class="stat-list">

### GENETIC DEFECT (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP or 20 CP

</div>

The morph is not genefixed, and in fact suffers
from a genetic disorder or other impairing mutation.
The player and gamemaster should agree on a defect
appropriate to their game. Some possibilities include:
heart disease, diabetes, cystic fibrosis sickle-cell disease,
hypertension, hemophilia, or color blindness. A genetic
disorder that creates minor complications and/or occasional
health problems would be worth 10 CP, a defect
that signifi antly impairs the character’s regular functioning
or that infl cts chronic health problems is worth
20 CP. The gamemaster must determine the exact
effects of the disorder on gameplay, as appropriate.

This trait is only available for flat

<div class="stat-list">

### IDENTITY CRISIS

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character’s ego has trouble adapting itself to
the changed look of a new morph—they are stuck
with the mental image of their original body and
simply do not grow accustomed to their new face(s).
As a result, the character has difficulty identifying
themselves in the mirror, photos, surveillance feeds,
etc. They frequently forget the look and shape of their
current morph, acting inappropriately, describing
themselves by their original body, forgetting to duck
when walking through doorways, etc. This is primarily
a roleplaying trait, but the gamemaster may apply
appropriate modifiers (usually –10) to tests affected
by this inability to adapt.

<div class="stat-list">

### ILLITERATE

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character knows how to speak but has difficulty
reading or writing. Due to the entoptic-saturated
and icon-driven nature of transhuman society, they
are able to get by quite comfortably with this handicap
Reduce the character’s Language skills by half
(round down) whenever reading or writing.

<div class="stat-list">

### IMMORTALITY BLUES

- **Cost:** 10 CP

The character has lived so long—over 100 years—they’re
bored with life and now have difficulty motivating
themselves. They were old when longevity
treatments first became available, survived the Fall,
and continue to soldier onward—though they fin
it increasingly harder to care, take interest in things
around them, or fear final death. The character only
receives half the Moxie and Rez Points award for
completing motivational goals.

This trait may not be purchased by characters with
the infolife, uplift, or lost backgrounds.
 

</div>

<div class="stat-list">

### IMPLANT REJECTION (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 5 (Level 1) or 15 (Level 2) CP

</div>

This morph does not accept implants well. At Level
1, any implants acquired are more expensive as they
required specialized anti-rejection treatments. Increase
the Cost category of the implant by one. At Level 2,
the morph cannot accept implants of any kind.

<div class="stat-list">

### INCOMPETENT

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character is completely incapable of performing
a particular chosen active skill, no matter any
training they may receive. They may not buy this skill
during character creation or later advancement, and
the modifier for defaulting to the linked aptitude of
this particular skill is –10. This may not be used for
exotic weapon skills, and should be used for a skill
that could be of use to the character.

<div class="stat-list">

### LEMON (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

This trait is only available for synthetic morphs.
This particular morph has some unfixable flaws.
Once per game session (preferably at a time that will
maximize drama or hilarity), the gamemaster can call
for the character to make a MOX × 10 Test (using
their current Moxie score). If the character fails, the
morph immediately suffers 1 wound resulting from
some mechanical failure, electrical glitch, or other
breakdown. This wound may be repaired as normal.

<div class="stat-list">

### LOW PAIN TOLERANCE (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 20 CP

</div>

Pain is the character’s enemy. The character has
a very low threshold for pain tolerance and is more
severely impaired when suffering. Increase the modifier
for each wound take by an additional –10 (so
the character suffers –20 with one wound, –40 with
another, and –60 with a third). Additionally, the
character suffers a –30 modifier on any test involving
pain resistance. The morph version of this trait is only
available for biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### MENTAL DISORDER

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

You have a psychological disorder from a previous
traumatic experience in your life. Choose one of the
disorders listed in [*Disorders*](../06/09-mental-health.md#disorders).

<div class="stat-list">

### MILD ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 5 CP

</div>

The morph is allergic to a specific chosen allergen
(dust, dander, plant pollen, certain chemicals) and
suffers mild discomfort when exposed to it (eye irritation,
sneezing, difficult breathing). Apply a –10 modifier
to all tests while the character remains exposed.
This trait is only available for biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### MODIFIED BEHAVIOR

- **Cost:** 5 (Level 1), 10 (Level 2), or 20 (Level 3) CP

</div>

The character has been conditioned via time-accelerated
behavioral control psychosurgery. This
is common among ex-felons, who have been conditioned
to respond to a specific idea or activity with
vehement horror and disgust, but may have occurred
for some other reason or even been self-inflicted
At Level 1, the chosen behavior is either *limited* or
*boosted*, at Level 2 it is either *blocked* or *encouraged*,
and at Level 3 it is *expunged* or *enforced* (see
[*Behavioral Control *](../07/03-psychosurgery.md#behavioral-control)
for details). This trait should only be allowed
for behaviors that are either limited or, if encouraged,
impact the character in a negative way.

<div class="stat-list">

### MORPHING DISORDER

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1), 20 (Level 2), or 30 (Level 3) CP

</div>

Adapting to new morphs is particularly challeng-
ing for this character. The character suffers a –10
modifier per level on 
[*Integration Tests*](../09/02-resleeving.md#integration) and
[*Alienation Tests*](../09/02-resleeving.md#alienation).

<div class="stat-list">

### NEURAL DAMAGE

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character has suffered some type of neurological
damage that simply cannot be cured. The affliction
is now part of the character’s ego and remains
with them even when remorphing. This damage may
have been inherited, it may have resulted from a
poorly designed morph or implant, or it may have
been inflicted by one of the
[TITAN nanoviruses](../11/11-titans.md#nanoviruses)
that targeted neural systems during the Fall. The
gamemaster and player should agree on a specifi
disorder appropriate to their game. Some possibilities are:

- Partial aphasia (difficulty communicating or
    using words)
- Color blindness
- Amusica (inability to make or understand music)
- Synaesthesia
- Logorrhoea (excessive use of words)
- Loss of face recognition
- Loss of depth perception (double range modifiers)
- Repetitive behavior
- Mood swings
- The inability to shift attention quickly

The gamemaster may decide to inflict modifier
resulting from this affliction as appropriate

<div class="stat-list">

### NO CORTICAL STACK (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The morph lacks the cortical stack that is common
to morphs of its type. This means the character cannot
be resleeved from the cortical stack if the character
dies, they can only be resleeved from a standard
backup. This trait is not available for flats

<div class="stat-list">

### OBLIVIOUS

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character is particularly oblivious to events
around them or anything other than what their
attention is focused on. They suffer a –10 modifier
to Surprise Tests and their modifier for being
Distracted is –30 rather than the usual –20 (see
[*Basic Perception*](../06/03-actions.md#basic-perception)).

<div class="stat-list">

### ON THE RUN

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character is wanted by the authorities of a
particular habitat/station or faction, who continue to
actively search for the character. They either committed
a crime or somehow displeased someone in power.
The character deals with that faction in question at
their own risk and may occasionally be forced to deal
with bounty hunters.

<div class="stat-list">

### PSI VULNERABILITY (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

Something about the character’s mind makes
them particularly vulnerable to psi attack. They
suffer a –10 modifier when resisting such attacks.
The morph version of this trait may only be taken
by biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### REAL WORLD NAIVETÉ

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

Due to their background, the character has very
limited personal experience with the real (physical)
world—or they have spent so much time in simul-
space that their functioning in real life is impaired.
They lack an understanding of many physical properties,
social cues, and other factors that people with
standard human upbringings take for granted. This
lack of common sense may lead the character to
misunderstand how a device works or to misinterpret
someone’s body language.

Once per game session, the gamemaster may
intentionally mislead the character when giving
them a description about some thing or some social
interaction. This falsehood represents the character’s
misunderstanding of the situation and should
be roleplayed appropriately, even if the player realizes
the character’s mistake.

This trait should only be available to characters
with the infolife or re-instantiated backgrounds,
though the gamemaster may allow it for characters
who have extensive virtual reality/XP use in their
personal histories.

<div class="stat-list">

### SEVERE ALLERGY (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (uncommon) or 20 (common) CP

</div>

The morph’s biochemistry suffers a severe allergic
reaction (anaphylaxis) when it comes into contact
(touched, inhaled, or ingested) with a specific allergen.
The allergen may be common (dust, dander, plant pollen,
certain foods, latex) or uncommon (certain drugs, insect
stings). The player and gamemaster should agree on an
allergen that fits the game. If exposed to the allergen,
the character breaks into hives, has difficulty to breathing
(–30 modifier to all actions), and must make a DUR
Test or go into anaphylactic shock (dying of respiratory
failure in 2d10 minutes unless medical care is applied).
This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### SLOW LEARNER

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

New skills are not easy for this character to pick
up. The character takes twice as long as normal to
improve skills or learn new ones (see
[*Improving Skills*](./04-character-advancement.md#improving-skills)).

<div class="stat-list">

### SOCIAL STIGMA (EGO OR MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

An unfortunate aspect of the character’s background
means that they suffer from a stigma in
certain social situations. They may be sleeved in
a morph viewed with repugnance, be a survivor of
the infamous Lost generation, or may be an AGI in
a post-Fall society plagued by fear of artificial
intelligence. In social situations where the character’s nature
is known to someone who view that nature with distaste,
fear, or repugnance, they suffer a –10 to –30
modifier (gamemaster’s discretion) to social skill tests.

<div class="stat-list">

### TIMID

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

This character frightens easily. They suffer a –10
modifier when resisting fear or intimidation

<div class="stat-list">

### UNATTRACTIVE (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2), 30 CP (Level 3)

</div>

In a time when good looks are easily purchased,
this morph is conspicuously ugly. As unattractiveness
is increasingly associated with being poor, backward,
or genetically defective, responses to a lack of good
looks range from distaste to horror. The character
suffers a –10 modifier on social tests for Level 1, –20
for Level 2, and –30 for Level 3.

Only biomorphs may take this trait. This modifier
does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs or
those with infolife or uplift backgrounds. This
modifier may be purchased for uplift morphs, but at
half the bonus, and it is only effective against
characters with that specific uplift background
(i.e., neo-avians, neo-hominids, etc.).

<div class="stat-list">

### UNCANNY VALLEY (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

There is a point where synthetic human looks become
uncannily realistic and human-seeming, but they remain
just different enough that their looks seem creepy or even
repulsive—a phenomenon called the “uncanny valley.”
Morphs whose looks fall into this range suffer a –10
modifier on social skill tests when dealing with humans.
This modifier does not apply to interactions with xenomorphs
or those with the infolife or uplift backgrounds.

<div class="stat-list">

### UNFIT (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP (Level 1), 20 CP (Level 2)

</div>

The morph is either not optimized for health and/or
just in bad shape. Reduce the aptitude maximums for
Coordination, Reflexes and Somatics by 5 (Level 1 )
or 10 (Level 2).

<div class="stat-list">

### VR VERTIGO

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

The character experiences intense vertigo and
nausea when interfacing with any type of virtual
reality, XP, or simulspace. Augmented reality has no
effect, but VR inflicts a –30 modifier to all of the character’s
actions. Prolonged use of VR (gamemaster’s
discretion) may actually incapacitate the character
should they fail a WIL × 2 Test.

<div class="stat-list">

### WEAK IMMUNE SYSTEM (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 (Level 1) or 20 (Level 2) CP

</div>

The morph’s immune system is susceptible to diseases,
drugs, and toxins. At Level 1, apply a –10 modifier
whenever making a test to resist infection or the effects
of a toxin or drug. At Level 2, increase this modifier to
–20. This trait is only available to biomorphs.

<div class="stat-list">

### ZERO-G NAUSEA (MORPH TRAIT)

- **Cost:** 10 CP

</div>

This morph suffers from space sickness and does
not fair well in zero gravity. The character suffers a
–10 modifier in any microgravity climate. Additionally,
whenever the character is first getting acclimated or
anytime they must endure excessive movement in
microgravity, they must make a WIL Test or spend 1
hour incapacitated by nausea per 10 points of MoF.
