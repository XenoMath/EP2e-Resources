# TERMINOLOGY

*Eclipse Phase* uses a variety of jargon to simply convey
the numerous concepts covered within the pages of this
book. While not all-inclusive, this list of terminology
will allow players to quickly acclimate themselves for
their journey into *Eclipse Phase*. If you read something
and are confused, don’t worry. These concepts are fully
explained in later sections of this book.

Note that several of the words on this list are
standard scientific terms, often used in astronomy. As
*Eclipse Phase* attempts to remain as close to “hard
science” as possible—while allowing players to interact
with the great stories waiting to unfold—such
terms are used liberally.
