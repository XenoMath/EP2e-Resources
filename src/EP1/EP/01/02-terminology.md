# TERMINOLOGY

*Eclipse Phase* uses a variety of jargon to simply convey
the numerous concepts covered within the pages of this
book. While not all-inclusive, this list of terminology
will allow players to quickly acclimate themselves for
their journey into *Eclipse Phase*. If you read something
and are confused, don’t worry. These concepts are fully
explained in later sections of this book.

Note that several of the words on this list are
standard scientific terms, often used in astronomy. As
*Eclipse Phase* attempts to remain as close to “hard
science” as possible—while allowing players to interact
with the great stories waiting to unfold—such
terms are used liberally.

## WELCOME TO FIREWALL
\[Incoming Message Recieved. Source:Unknown\]<br>
\[Quantum Analysis: No Interception Detected\]<br>
\[Decryption Complete\]

**Greetings**

Your references and background
have been triple-checked and confirmed, and you are now vetted as
a sentinel operative. Welcome to
Firewall, friend.

For those new to our private
network, Firewall is an organization dedicated to protecting
transhumanity from threats—both internal and external—to our
continued existence as a species. The Fall may have reminded us that
our ability to survive and prosper
is not guaranteed, but our kind
has a remarkably short attention
span. Despite our achievement of
functional near-immortality, we
continue to face numerous dangers
that may contribute to our extinction. Some of these risks come from
our own factionalism and divisiveness, combined with universally
available technology that could
cause widespread destruction and
untold deaths in the wrong hands.
Some stem from our short-sightedness, failing to see the dangers
in which we place ourselves and
our environments through careless actions. Some arise from our
own creations turned against us,
as the TITANs proved. Other risks
may come from alien intelligences
whose motivations we cannot yet
fathom, and of whom we may not
even be aware. Still others may
threaten us by sheer chance and
the mindless but deadly cause-and-effect of a universe in which we are
but an insignificant speck.

Firewall exists to identify, analyze,
and counter these risks. We are all
volunteers. We are all placing our
own lives at risk in order to ensure
the survival of transhumanity.

Firewall has existed, under other
names and guises, since before
the Fall. Numerous agencies with
a similar agenda banded together
in the wake of those cataclysmic
events to assess our situation and
prepare for the worst. Now we
operate under a single umbrella.

We are a private network for two
reasons. First, our existence and
operational abilities are protected
by our secrecy. The less our opposition knows about us, the more
effectively we can counter them.
Similarly, certain authorities might
be hostile to an organization such
as ours operating in their claimed
territory. Though some may be
aware of our existence, we bypass
numerous legal and jurisdictional
hurdles that might otherwise
hamper our actions and goals.
Second, our mission sometimes
brings to light information that is
not only dangerous in the wrong
hands, but might even trigger
widespread panic if made public. In
some cases, the very existence of
such knowledge could be problematic. 
By retaining secrecy and operating on a need-to-know basis, we
automatically counter certain risks.

Firewall is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network. We have minimal
hierarchy and we answer to no one
but ourselves. Our node structure
enables us to share resources and
talents without sacrificing the
privacy and security of our operatives.

You have been recruited because
of your knowledge, assets or skills,
and/or because you have come into
contact with certain restricted data.
You have proven your willingness
to support our goals. Our lives and
existence—and the future of transhumanity—may rest in your hands.

So here’s to the future—may we all live to see it.

## WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW
\[Incoming Message Recieved. Source:Unknown\]<br>
\[Quantum Analysis: No Interception Detected\]<br>
\[Decryption Complete\]

**Sit down, and grab yourself a fucking drink.**

Forget all of that AI-generated
intro crap you just read. Here’s the
real deal.

You’re probably dying to know
what you’ve been dragged into.
Maybe you’ve been told the party
line already: that we’re all that
stands between transhumanity
and extinction. Or maybe someone
whispered to you that we’re a rogue
operation that meddles in heavy
shit that we have no authority to
get involved in and that we sometimes get people killed as a result.
You must be curious. Maybe you’ve
got a vigilante streak and you’re
looking to spill blood for a good
cause. Would it matter to you if the
cause was a deluded one? Maybe
you’re a conspiracy wingnut and
you’re dying to know what secrets
Firewall is clutching to its collective
chest. What if those secrets shattered the carefully constructed lies
that we all tell to ourselves to keep
our sanity intact?

Everything you’ve heard, good or
bad, about Firewall very well may
be true. We’re not angels. We lost
the sheen on our ideals when the
TITANs forcibly uploaded their first
human mind. Right now, you should
be asking yourself what the fuck you
just signed up for. I did.

Truth is, Firewall is lots of things.
Most of it is good, but a lot of it
so fucking horrible you’ll be think-
ing about planting a bullet in your
stack and resorting to an earlier
backup just so you can forget it all.
If you have any romantic visions
about being a hero, drop them now.
You won’t feel like a hero when
you airlock some kid because he’s
carrying an infectious nanovirus.
You won’t feel brave when you run
across some alien thing and crap
your pants. And you won’t even
feel human anymore when you
make a call that will cost dozens,
hundreds, or even thousands of
people their lives, even if you are
saving millions more.

So why would anyone be crazy
enough to be part of this thing?
Because it needs to be done. Our
survival depends on it. To some
people, it’s altruism, defending
transhumanity. But really, it’s about
saving your own fucking neck
too. Sure, you could abstain from
taking responsibility and let some
self-described authority take care
of it. But if the anarchists have
anything right, it’s that people in
power can’t be trusted. As often as
not, they’re part of the problem. So
Firewall does things the collective
way. We’re underground, but we’re
an open source operation. We share
information and resources towards
a common goal. We organize in
networked ad-hoc cells, smart-mob
style. We don’t let anyone accrue too
much power or control. Everyone
involved in an op has an equal
say. We police ourselves. We come
from all sorts of backgrounds and
factions, but we face a common
enemy—and we fight to win. There
is no alternative.

Maybe you’ve heard of the Fermi
Paradox? That question asked why,
with a galaxy so huge, there were so
few signs of other life? Even though
we’ve met the Factors and seen
evidence of other aliens, our galactic
neighborhood should be crawling
with intelligence—but it’s not.

I’ll tell you why. The universe
is not fucking fair. If transhuman-
ity were wiped out, the galaxy
wouldn’t even notice. Just look at
the Earth. That planet still exists,
still supports life, even though
we’re far gone. Reality is an uncaring asshole. Forget all that utopian
crap about living forever. We’ll be
lucky to survive another year. We’ve
developed technologies that put
weapons of mass destruction in the
hands of everyone, but we’re still an
adolescent species that has trouble
overcoming petty tribal bullshit. If
you’re really looking forward to
exploring the universe as a postmortal, you’re going to have to
work hard at it. Survival isn’t a right,
it’s a privilege.

When you sign up with Firewall,
you put yourself on call. Anytime
some shit goes down in your neck
of the woods or that you might be
particularly helpful in dealing with,
you’ll get a call. You’ll be expected
to drop whatever you’re doing and
put everything else on hold as if
your life depended on it—it probably does. When you’re in the field,
on an op—”going to the doctor,” as
we call it—your cell is empowered
to act as it sees fit … just keep in
mind that you’ll be answering to
the rest of us later. You’ll also have
the Firewall network to back you
up—though resources are often
limited, so don’t expect us to always
save your ass. Other sentinels can be
called on to pull strings, but every
time we do so, it threatens to unveil
an agent, create a trail that we need
to clean up, and otherwise complicates matters. Self-reliance is key.

One last thing: don’t ever, ever
forget that we have enemies. I’m
not just talking about the nutjob
who wants to nuke a habitat to
make a political statement or the
neo-luddites who think biowar
plagues will teach us all a lesson,
I’m talking about the agencies that
know Firewall exists and consider it
a threat. If they tag you as a sentinel,
your days are numbered. Maybe
your backups too. So watch yer
friggin’ back.

So that’s the real deal, as honest
as I can give it. Welcome to our secret
clubhouse, comrade. Remember: death
is just another day on the job.
