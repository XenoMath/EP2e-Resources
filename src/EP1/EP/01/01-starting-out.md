# STARTING OUT

*Eclipse Phase* is a post-apocalyptic roleplaying game of transhuman conspiracy and horror. Humans are enhanced and improved, but humanity is battered and bitterly divided. Technology allows the reshaping of bodies and minds and liberates us from material needs, but also creates opportunities for oppression and puts the capability for mass destruction in the hands of everyone. Many threats lurk in the devastated habitats of the Fall, dangers both familiar and alien.

## WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?

Have you ever read a book or seen a movie or a television show where a character does something really stupid, like heading into a basement at night when the character knows the serial killer is around? The whole time, you’re thinking: “I wouldn’t walk down those creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a flashlight I’d do X, Y, or Z instead!” Since you’re in the passenger’s seat for the plot you’re reading or watching, however, you simply have to sit back and let it unfold.

What if you could take hold of the driver’s seat? What if you could take the plot in the direction you’d choose? That is the essence of a roleplaying game.

A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part improvisational theater, part storytelling, and part game. A single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for a group of players that pretend to be characters in a fictitious world. The world could be a mystery game set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around the globe, a fantasy realm inhabited by dragons and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a science fiction setting with aliens and spaceships and world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting that they find cool and want to play in. The players then craft their own characters, providing a detailed history and personality to bring each to life. These characters have a set of statistics (numerical values) that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities. The gamemaster then explains the situation in which the characters find themselves. The players, through their characters, interact with the storyline and each other’s characters, acting out the plot. As the players roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will probably ask a given player to roll some dice and the resulting numbers will determine the success or failure of a character’s attempted action. The gamemaster uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls and the outcome of the character’s actions.

As a group exercise, the players control the storyline (the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or book but within the flexible plot created by the gamemaster. This gamemaster plot provides a framework and ideas for potential courses of action and outcomes, but it is simply an outline of what might happen—it is not concrete until the players become involved. If you don’t want to walk down those stairs, you don’t. If you think you can talk yourself out of a situation in place of pulling a gun, then try and make it happen. The script of any roleplaying session is written by the players, and the story, based upon the character’s actions and their responses the events of the plot, will constantly change and to evolve.

The best part is that there is no “right” or “wrong” way to play an RPG. Some games may involve more combat and dice rolling-related situations, where other games may involve more storytelling and improvised dialogue to resolve a situation. Each group of players decides for themselves the type and style of game they enjoy playing!

## POST-APOCALYPTIC, CONSPIRACY, AND HORROR THEMES

Several themes pervade *Eclipse Phase*, some with which the reader may not be intimately familiar. The following helps define these themes so that as players read further into this rulebook, they gain a solid understanding of how *Eclipse Phase* builds on such themes to create its unique setting.

*Post-apocalyptic* is a term used to describe fiction
set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civilization as we know it (usually accompanied by loss of human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact mechanism of the disaster is usually unimportant: nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The importance of the theme is the human condition. If the world we know is torn away from us and humans suffer horrors beyond imagining in this transformation to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does humanity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome? Do we lose our own humanity in the process? Or ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions that drive this genre.

To *conspire* means “to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end.” As such, a conspiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an event or a chain of events (whether political, societal or historical) to a secret group of individuals with immense power (political clout, wealth, and so on) who hide their activities from public view while manipulating events to achieve their goals, regardless of consequences. Many conspiracy theories contend that a host of the greatest events of history were initiated and ultimately controlled by such secret organizations. Of equal importance is the silent struggle between clandestine groups, waging a secret war behind the scenes to determine who influences the future.

*Horror* takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things among the stars, and fear of the unknown. It is the dread of facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion when encountering alien things, and the sickening realization of the wrong and ghastly things that transhumans are capable of doing to themselves and each other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension that there are scary things beyond our understanding inhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the technological tools and advances available to future transhumans, they still face terrors like losing control of their own identities, their perceptions, and their mental faculties—not to mention their future as a species.

Eclipse Phase takes all of these themes and weaves them together in a transhuman setting. The post-apocalyptic angle covers the understanding of all that transhumanity has lost, the fight against extinction, and how much of that is a struggle against our own nature. The conspiracy side delves into the nature of the secret organizations that play key roles in determining transhumanity’s future and how the actions of determined individuals can change the lives of many. The horror perspective explores the results of humanity’s self-inflicted transformations and how some of these changes effectively make us non-human. Tying it all together is an awareness of the massive indifference and the terrible *alien-ness* that pervades the universe and how transhumanity is insignificant against such a backdrop.

Offsetting these themes, however, *Eclipse Phase* also asserts that there is hope, that there is something worth fighting for, and that transhumanity can and will pave its own path toward the future.

## BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PLAY?

To play a game of *Eclipse Phase*, you need the following:

- A group of players and a place to meet (real life or online!)
- One player to act as the gamemaster
- The contents of this book
- Something for everyone to take notes with (notepads, laptops, whatever!)
- Two 10-sided dice per player (or a digital equivalent)
- Imagination

### A GROUP OF PLAYERS AND A PLACE TO MEET

While roleplaying games are flexible enough to allow
any number of people, most gaming groups number
around four to eight players. That number of people
brings a good mix of personalities to the table and
ensures great cooperative play.

Once a group of players have determined to play
*Eclipse Phase*, they’ll need to designate someone as
the gamemaster (see below). Then they’ll need to
determine a time and place to meet.

Most roleplaying groups meet once a week at a regularly scheduled time and place: 7:00 PM, Thursday
night, Rob’s house, for example. However, each group
determines where, how they’ll play, and how often.
One group may decide they can only get together
once a month, while another group is so excited to
dive into the story potential of *Eclipse Phase* that
they want to meet twice a week (they decide to rotate
between their houses, though, so as not to overload a
particular player). If a group is lucky enough to have a
favorite local gaming store that supports in-store play,
the group might meet there. Other gaming groups
meet in libraries, common rooms at their school,
bookstores that have generously sized “reading
rooms,” quiet restaurants, and so on. Whatever fit
for your gaming group, make it work!

When getting together for a game, most RPGs
use the phrase “gaming session.” The length of
each gaming session is completely dependent upon
the consensus of the playing group, as well as the
limitations of the locale where they’re playing. The
particular story that unfolds in a given session can
also impact a session’s length. If playing in a game
store, the group may only have a four-hour slot and
the gamemaster and group may have determined—
through several sessions of play—that this is a perfect
time frame to enjoy the story they’re participating in
each week. Another group, however, may want an
even shorter length of time. Yet another group may
decide that while they’ll usually do four-hour sessions,
once a month they’ll set aside an entire Saturday for
a great all-day gaming session. Players will need to
dive in and start playing and be fl xible to decide
what will provide the ultimate enjoyment for their
gaming group.

While the camaraderie of a shared experience of
playing face-to-face with a group of friends remains
the strength of roleplaying games, groups need not
confine themselves to a single mode of play. There are
myriad options that can be used. Email, instant mes-
sages, message boards, video chats, phone/voip calls,
text messages, wikis, (micro-)blogs: any and all of
these can be utilized to play the game without having
warm bodies in seats directly across the table from
one another.

Finally, when playing groups meet for the first time,
they should generate their characters (as opposed to
generating characters by themselves). While a gaming
group can decide to generate characters individually,
often it is far easier once the players are together.
This allows those more experienced to help those new
to RPGs. Even more important, it enables the entire
group to tailor the characters so there is not too
much overlap in capabilities and style. After all, with
the wealth of character opportunities available, you
don’t want to show up at the table with an almost
identical character to the player next to you.

### THE GAMEMASTER

Once a group has been organized, someone needs to
step up and take the reins of the gamemaster. Some
groups have a single gamemaster that runs all their
gaming sessions month after month. Other groups
rotate a gamemaster, with a single person running
a given portion of the unfolding story for several
games before handing the work off to another player.
Once again, the participants should be flexible Some
groups may have the perfect person who loves the
work involved and is more than willing to run session
after session, while other groups may decide that they
all want to take turns both as the gamemaster and
as players.

The gamemaster controls the story. They keep track
of what is supposed to happen when, describe events
as they occur so that the players (as characters) can
react to them, keep track of other characters in the
game (referred to as non-player characters, or NPCs),
and resolve attempts to take action using the game
system. The game system comes into play when characters seek to use their skills or otherwise do something that requires a test to see whether or not they
succeed. Specific rules are presented for situations that
involve rolling dice to determine the outcome 
([see the *Game Mechanics* chapter](../03/00-game-mechanics.md)).

The gamemaster describes the world as the characters
 see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and
other senses. Gamemastering is not easy, but the
thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other
players’ imaginations, testing their gaming skills and
their characters’ skills in the game world, makes
it worthwhile. Posthuman Studios will follow the
publication of *Eclipse Phase* with supporting supplements
and adventures to help this process along,
but experienced gamemasters can always adapt
the game universe to suit their own styles. In fact,
since *Eclipse Phase* is published under a Creative
Commons license, (see [license](../../../license.md)), players are encouraged
to tailor the universe to their style of play and also
to share that with other players. You never know
when a specific choice you’ve made in the running of
a campaign is exactly what another gamemaster and
his group is looking for.

### THE CONTENTS OF THIS BOOK

### TAKING NOTES

Whether a gamemaster or player, you’ll need a way
to track information. Players will be generating 
characters and making changes to those characters from
session to session. Meanwhile, the gamemaster will
have a host of information to track: notes on how
the story is unfolding due to player character interaction 
that you’ll need to fold into next week’s session;
changes to NPCs; changes to player characters that
the players are not yet aware off (e.g., a character
 has been mind hacked but doesn’t yet know it); and so on.

Additionally, some groups enjoy a synopsis of each
session that can be compiled and read at a later time
in order to enjoy and share their exploits, just as you
might fileshare clips from your favorite video game
to show off your skill in taking the bad guy down
(traditionally this has been called “bluebooking”).
This can be particularly useful if a player was unable
to attend a given session, providing a quick re-cap
that they can read before attending the next gaming
session and thus avoiding a bog-down up-front as
that player tries to catch up on current events in the
game. The session scribe can be a shared responsibility
or assigned, all based on what a given playing group
finds works best for them. Likewise, some gaming
groups audio-record their entire game session, both
for later reference and for “actual play” podcasts.

The old standard of a pencil and paper still works
wonders. Digital technologies, however, provide many
new options for players. From a text file on a laptop
to a shared wiki, the ability to track large amounts
of information in a quick and useful fashion—while
simultaneously making appropriate information
available to each player from session to 
session—significantly decreases how much time everyone needs
to spend tracking information. That time can now
be redirected into the enjoyment of participating in
a great story.

### DICE

As described in the Game Mechanics chapter 
([see Dice](../03/01-the-ultimate-rule.md#dice)), two ten-sided dice are required to play
Eclipse Phase. While most players enjoy the feel of
tossing dice onto a table, there are many other mecha-
nisms for rolling two ten-sided dice to achieve a 00 to
99 result. Players who make heavy use of any online
technologies for game play—such as using online chat-
ting or video blogging—should find it easy to track
down and implement a quick dice-rolling program.

### IMAGINATION

All too often, it’s easy for someone looking at an RPG
to be intimidated. So many concepts to grasp, so many
ideas that seem overwhelming. Just as described under
*What is a Roleplaying Game?*, however, how often
have you read a book or watched that movie and
decided that you would have done it better? That’s
your imagination at work. Just dive in and you’ll be
amazed at how quickly you can immerse yourself in
the *Eclipse Phase* universe. Soon you’ll be spinning
stories with the best of them.

Also, don’t forget to tap your resources. Your
gaming group is your best resource. What’s going on,
ideas for how to handle a situation, or how to take
on a bad guy: these are just some of the things that
can and should be discussed by the gaming group
in between sessions, and each is an opportunity to
strengthen your imagination.

Another resource is simply watching TV or reading
a good book. Pay attention to how the story is put
together, how the characters are built, and how the
plot unfolds. Push your imagination and soon you’ll
be figuring out subplots and who the bad guy is long
before it’s revealed. Knowing how a story is put
together enables you to put together your own stories
during each gaming session.

Finally, [eclipsephase.com](https://eclipsephase.com/) is the official site for
*Eclipse Phase*. If you have questions about the game
or want to see how another group of players handles
a given situation, post on the forums. The online community
can be just as helpful and enjoyable as a local
gaming group.

## WHAT DO PLAYERS DO?

The players can take on a variety of roles in *Eclipse Phase*.
Due to advances in digital mind-emulation
technology, uploading, and downloading into new
morphs (physical bodies, both biological and synthetic),
it is possible to literally be a new person from
session to session. With bodies taking on the role of
gear, players can customize their forms for the task
at hand.

### THE DEFAULT CAMPAIGN

In the default story (also known as the “campaign
setting”), every player character is a “sentinel,” an
agent-on-call (or potential recruit) for a shadowy
network known as “Firewall.” Firewall is dedicated
to counteracting “existential risks”—threats to the
existence of transhumanity. These risks include
biowar plagues, nanotech swarm outbreaks, nuclear
proliferation, terrorists with WMDs, net-breaking
computer attacks, rogue AIs, alien encounters, and so
on. Firewall isn’t content to simply counteract these
threats as they arise, of course, so characters may also
be sent on information-gathering missions or to put
in place pre-emptive or failsafe measures. Characters
may be tasked to investigate seemingly innocuous
people and places (who turn out not to be), make
deals with shady criminal networks (who turn out not
to be trustworthy), or travel through a Pandora gate
wormhole to analyze the relics of some alien ruin (and
see if the threat that killed them is still real). Sentinels
are recruited from every faction of transhumanity;
those who aren’t ideologically loyal to the cause are
hired as mercenaries. These campaigns tend to mix a
bit of mystery and investigation with fi rce bouts of
action and combat, also stirring in a nice dose of awe
and horror.

### ALTERNATE CAMPAIGNS

When they’re not saving the solar system, sentinels are
free to pursue their own endeavors. The gamemaster
and players can use this rulebook to generate any type
of story they wish to tell. The following examples
provide a brief look at the most obvious opportunities
for adventure in *Eclipse Phase*.

After each campaign variant below, a list of
“archetypes” for *Eclipse Phase* are provided in
parenthesis. Archetypes are the names applied to
the most common character types featured in those
scenarios. For example, in a traditional detective
story, the archetypes would be the Detective, the
Damsel In Distress, the Hard-bitten Cop, and so
on. In a cowboy movie, the archetypes would be the
Gunfighte , the Bartender, the Marshal, the Indian
Brave, etc. Players will note that some archetypes fi
into multiple story settings. 
The [character creation system](../04/00-character-creation-advancement.md) 
allows players to create any of the
suggested archetypes. Just as roleplaying games are
designed for players to build their own stories, these
archetypes are just suggestions and players can mix
and match as they please.

**Salvage and Rescue/Retrieval Ops:** The Fall left
the Earth and numerous habitats in ruins—but these
devastated cities and stations contain untold riches
for those who are brave and foolhardy enough.
Potential hauls include: weapon systems; physical
resources; lost databanks; left-behind uploads of
friends, family, or important people; new technologies
developed and lost in the brief singularity
takeoff; valued heirlooms of immortal oligarchs;
and much more. Outside of these once-inhabited
realms, space itself is a big place and lots of people
and things get lost out there. Some need to be saved
and some are beyond saving. This option lets players
explore the unknown or seek out specific targets on
contract. (Archeologist/Scavenger/Pirate/Free Trader/
Smuggler/Black Marketeer)

**Exploration:** There are plenty of opportunities
to be had as an explorer, colonist, or long-range
scout—perhaps even as one of the few lucky or suicidal
individuals who explore through an untested
Pandora gate. Even the Kuiper Belt, on the fringe
of our solar system, is still sparsely explored; there
may be riches and mysteries still to be found. Many
dangers also lurk in odd corners of the system, from
isolationist posthuman factions to secretive criminal
cartels, as well as pirates, aliens, and others wishing
to remain out of sight. (Explorer/Archeologist/
Scavenger/Singularity Seeker/Techie/Medic)

**Trade:** While the majority of inner system trade is
controlled by sleek hypercorporations, many of the
smaller or more independent stations rely on small
traders. In the post-scarcity outer system, trade takes
on a different form, with information, favors, and
creativity serving as currency among those who no
longer want for anything due to the availability of
cornucopia machines. (Free Trader/Smuggler/Black
Marketeer/Pirate)

**Crime:** The patchwork of city-state habitats and
widely varying laws throughout the system creates
ample opportunity for those who would make a
living from this situation. Black market commodi-
ties and activities include infomorph-slave trading,
pleasure pod sex industries, data brokerage and
theft, extracting/smuggling advanced technologies
and scientists, political/economic espionage, assas-
sination, drug and XP dealing, soul-trading, and
much more. Whether as an independent or part of
an organized criminal element, there are always
opportunities for those with a thirst for adven-
ture or profit and questionable morals. (Criminal/
Smuggler/Pirate/Fixer/Black Marketeer/Genehacker/
Hacker/Covert Ops)

**Mercenaries:** The constant maneuvering of
ideologically driven factions, the squabbling over
contested resources, and the rush to colonize new
exoplanets beyond the Pandora gates all spark new
conflicts on a regular basis. Some of these simmer
and seethe as low-intensity conflicts for years, occa-
sionally flaring into raids and clashes. Others break
out into all-out warfare. Women and men willing
to bear arms for credits are always in demand for
good wages. Players can engage in commando and
military campaigns in habitats, between the stars, or
in hostile planetary environments. (Merc/Security
Specialist/Fixer/Bounty Hunter/Ex-Cop/Medic)

**Socio-Political Intrigue:** The corporations and
political factions that span the solar system do not
always play nice with each other, but neither is it
wise for them to openly confront each other except
under extreme circumstances. Many battles are
fought with diplomacy and political maneuvering,
using words and ideas more potent than weapons.
Even within factions, social cliques can compete
ruthlessly and heated class conflicts can come to
a boil, tearing a society apart from within. In this
campaign, the players can start as pawns of some
entity who rise through the ranks as they become
more enmeshed in the intrigues of their sponsor, play
a group of ambassadors and spies stationed in the
opposition’s capital, or run as a group of activists
and radicals fighting for social change. 
(Politico/Socialite/Covert Ops/Hacker/Security Specialist/Journalist/Memeticist)

## WHERE DOES IT TAKE PLACE?

While *Eclipse Phase* is set in the not-too-distant future,
the changes that have taken place due to the advancements
of technology have transformed the Earth and
its inhabitants almost beyond recognition. As players
dive into the universe, they’ll generally encounter one
of the following settings.

### TRANSHUMANITY’S HABITATS

The Earth has been left an ecologically devastated
ruin, but transhumanity has taken to the stars. When
Earth was abandoned, so too were the last of the great
nation-states; transhumanity now lacks a single unifying
governing body and is instead subject to the laws
and regulations of whomever controls a given habitat.

The majority of transhumanity is confined to orbital
habitats or satellite stations scattered throughout the
solar system. Some of these were constructed from
scratch in the orbit or Lagrange points of planetary
bodies, others have been hewn out of solid satellites
and large asteroids. These stations have myriad purposes
from trade to warfare, espionage to research.

Mars continues to be one of transhumanity’s largest
settlements, though it too suffered heavily during the
Fall. Numerous cities and settlements remain, and
more are established each year, though the planet is
only partially terraformed. Venus, Luna, and Titan
are also home to significant populations. Additionally,
there are a small number of colonies that have been
established on exoplanets (on the other side of the
Pandora gates) with environments that are not too
hostile towards humanity.

Some transhumans prefer to live on large colony
ships or linked swarms of smaller spacecraft, moving
nomadically. Some of these rovers intentionally exile
themselves to the far limits of the solar system, far
from everyone else, while others actively trade from
habitat to habitat, station to station, serving as mobile
black markets.

### THE GREAT UNKNOWN

The areas of the galaxy that have felt the touch of
humanity are few and far between. Lying betwixt
these occasional outposts of questionable civilization
are mysteries both dangerous and wonderful. Ever
since the discovery of the Pandora gates, there has
been no shortage of adventurers brave or foolhardy
enough to strike out on their own into the unknown
regions of space in hopes of finding more alien artifacts,
or even establishing contact with one of the
other sentient races in the universe

### THE MESH

While not a “setting” in the traditional sense, as the
sections describe above, the computer networks
known as the “mesh” are all-pervasive. This ubiquitous
computing environment is made possible
thanks to advanced computer and nanofabrication
technologies that allow unlimited data storage and
near-instantaneous transmission capacities. With
micro-scale, cheap-to-produce wireless transceivers so
abundant, literally everything is wirelessly connected
and online. Via implants or small personal computers,
characters have access to archives of information
that dwarf the entire 21 st-century internet and sensor
systems that pervade every public place. People’s
entire lives are recorded and lifelogged, shared with
others on one of numerous social networks that link
everyone together in a web of contacts, favors, and
reputation systems.

## EGO vs . MORPH

The distinction between ego (your mind and personality,
including memories, knowledge, and skills) and
morph (your physical body and its capabilities) is one
of the defining characteristics of *Eclipse Phase*. A good
understanding of the concept right up front will allow
players a glimpse at all the story possibilities out of
the gate.

Your body is disposable. If it gets old, sick, or too
heavily damaged, you can digitize your consciousness
and download into a new one. The process isn’t cheap
or easy, but it does guarantee you effective immortality—as
long as you remember to back yourself up and
don’t go insane. The term *morph* is used to describe
any type of form your mind inhabits, whether a 
vat-grown clone sleeve, a synthetic robotic shell, a 
part-bio/part-synthetic “pod,” or even the purely electronic
software state of an infomorph.

A character’s morph may die, but the character’s
ego may live on, assuming appropriate backup measures
 have been taken. Morphs are expendable, but
your character’s ego represents the ongoing, continuous
life path of your character’s mind and personality.
This continuity may be interrupted by an unexpected
death (depending on how recently the backup was
made), but it represents the totality of the character’s
mental state and experiences.

Some aspects of your character—particularly skills,
along with some stats and traits—belong to your
character’s ego and so stay with them throughout
the character’s development. Some stats and traits,
however, are determined by morph, as noted, and
so will change if your character leaves one body and
takes on another. Morphs may also affect other skills
and stats, as detailed in the morph description.

## WHERE TO GO FROM HERE?

Now that you know what this game is about, we
suggest that you next read the 
[*A Time Of Eclipse chapter*](../02/00-time-eclipse.md),
to get a feel for the game’s default
setting (which you are, of course, free to change to
suit your whims). Then read 
the [*Game Mechanics chapter*](../03/00-game-mechanics.md),
to get a grasp of the rules. After
that, you can move on to 
[*Character Creation and Advancement*](../04/00-character-creation-advancement.md)
and create your first character!
