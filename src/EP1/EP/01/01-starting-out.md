# ENTER THE SINGULARITY

We humans have a special way of pulling ourselves up and kicking ourselves down at the same time. We’d achieved more progress than ever before, at the cost of wrecking our planet and destabilizing our own governments. But things were starting to look up. 

With exponentially accelerating technologies, we reached out into the solar system, terraforming worlds and seeding new life. We reforged our bodies and minds, casting off sickness and death. We achieved immortality through the digitization of our minds, resleeving from one biological or synthetic body to the next at will. We uplifted animals and AIs to be our equals. We acquired the means to build anything we desired from the molecular level up, so that no one need want again. 

Yet our race toward extinction was not slowed and in fact received a machine-assist over the precipice. Billions died as our technologies rapidly bloomed into something beyond control … further transforming humanity into something else, scattering us throughout the solar system, and re-igniting vicious conflicts Nuclear strikes, biowarfare plagues, nanoswarms, mass uploads … a thousand horrors nearly wiped humanity from existence. 

We still survive, divided into a patchwork of restrictive inner system hypercorp-backed oligarchies and libertarian outer system collectivist habitats, tribal networks, and new experimental societal models. We have spread to the outer reaches of the solar system and even gained footholds in the galaxy beyond. But we are no longer solely “human” … we have evolved into something simultaneously more and different—something **transhuman**.

## WHAT IS TRANSHUMANISM?

Transhumanism is a term used synonymously to mean “human enhancement.” It is an international cultural and intellectual movement that endorses the use of science and technology to enhance the human condition, both mentally and physically. In support of this, transhumanism also embraces using emerging technologies to eliminate the undesirable elements of the human condition such as aging, disabilities, diseases, and involuntary death. Many transhumanists believe these technologies will be arriving in our near future at an exponentially accelerated pace and work to promote universal access to and democratic control. In the long scheme of things, transhumanism can also be considered the transitional period between the current human condition and an entity so far advanced in capabilities (both physical and mental faculties) as to merit the label “posthuman.” 

As a theme, transhumanism embraces heady questions. What defines human? What does it mean to defeat death? If minds are software, where do you draw the line with programming them? If machines and animals can also be raised to sapience, what are our responsibilities to them? If you can copy yourself, where does “you” end and someone new begin? What are the potentials of these technologies in terms of both oppressive control and liberation? How will these technologies change our societies, our cultures, and our lives?

## STARTING OUT

*Eclipse Phase* is a post-apocalyptic roleplaying game of transhuman conspiracy and horror. Humans are enhanced and improved, but humanity is battered and bitterly divided. Technology allows the reshaping of bodies and minds and liberates us from material needs, but also creates opportunities for oppression and puts the capability for mass destruction in the hands of everyone. Many threats lurk in the devastated habitats of the Fall, dangers both familiar and alien.

### WHAT IS A ROLEPLAYING GAME?

Have you ever read a book or seen a movie or a television show where a character does something really stupid, like heading into a basement at night when the character knows the serial killer is around? The whole time, you’re thinking: “I wouldn’t walk down those creepy stairs to the dark basement, especially without a flashlight I’d do X, Y, or Z instead!” Since you’re in the passenger’s seat for the plot you’re reading or watching, however, you simply have to sit back and let it unfold.

What if you could take hold of the driver’s seat? What if you could take the plot in the direction you’d choose? That is the essence of a roleplaying game.

A roleplaying game (or RPG, for short) is part improvisational theater, part storytelling, and part game. A single person (the gamemaster) runs the game for a group of players that pretend to be characters in a fictitious world. The world could be a mystery game set in the 1920s that takes you adventuring around the globe, a fantasy realm inhabited by dragons and trolls and sword-wielding barbarians, or a science fiction setting with aliens and spaceships and world-crushing weaponry. The players pick a setting that they find cool and want to play in. The players then craft their own characters, providing a detailed history and personality to bring each to life. These characters have a set of statistics (numerical values) that represent skills, attributes, and other abilities. The gamemaster then explains the situation in which the characters find themselves. The players, through their characters, interact with the storyline and each other’s characters, acting out the plot. As the players roleplay through some scenarios, the gamemaster will probably ask a given player to roll some dice and the resulting numbers will determine the success or failure of a character’s attempted action. The gamemaster uses the rules of the game to interpret the dice rolls and the outcome of the character’s actions.

As a group exercise, the players control the storyline (the adventure), which evolves much like any movie or book but within the flexible plot created by the gamemaster. This gamemaster plot provides a framework and ideas for potential courses of action and outcomes, but it is simply an outline of what might happen—it is not concrete until the players become involved. If you don’t want to walk down those stairs, you don’t. If you think you can talk yourself out of a situation in place of pulling a gun, then try and make it happen. The script of any roleplaying session is written by the players, and the story, based upon the character’s actions and their responses the events of the plot, will constantly change and to evolve.

The best part is that there is no “right” or “wrong” way to play an RPG. Some games may involve more combat and dice rolling-related situations, where other games may involve more storytelling and improvised dialogue to resolve a situation. Each group of players decides for themselves the type and style of game they enjoy playing!

## POST-APOCALYPTIC, CONSPIRACY, AND HORROR THEMES

Several themes pervade *Eclipse Phase*, some with which the reader may not be intimately familiar. The following helps define these themes so that as players read further into this rulebook, they gain a solid understanding of how *Eclipse Phase* builds on such themes to create its unique setting.

*Post-apocalyptic* is a term used to describe fiction
set after a cataclysmic event has ended human civilization as we know it (usually accompanied by loss of human life on an almost unthinkable scale). The exact mechanism of the disaster is usually unimportant: nuclear war, plague, asteroid strike, and so on. The importance of the theme is the human condition. If the world we know is torn away from us and humans suffer horrors beyond imagining in this transformation to a post-apocalyptic setting, how does humanity cope? Do we survive and thrive and overcome? Do we lose our own humanity in the process? Or ultimately fall to extinction? Those are the questions that drive this genre.

To *conspire* means “to join in a secret agreement to do an unlawful or wrongful act or to use such means to accomplish a lawful end.” As such, a conspiracy theory attributes the ultimate cause of an event or a chain of events (whether political, societal or historical) to a secret group of individuals with immense power (political clout, wealth, and so on) who hide their activities from public view while manipulating events to achieve their goals, regardless of consequences. Many conspiracy theories contend that a host of the greatest events of history were initiated and ultimately controlled by such secret organizations. Of equal importance is the silent struggle between clandestine groups, waging a secret war behind the scenes to determine who influences the future.

*Horror* takes many forms, but in Eclipse Phase it is more psychological than gore. It is the uncertainty of survival, the suspense of finding malevolent things among the stars, and fear of the unknown. It is the dread of facing Things That Should Not Be, the revulsion when encountering alien things, and the sickening realization of the wrong and ghastly things that transhumans are capable of doing to themselves and each other. Horror also arises both from the comprehension that there are scary things beyond our understanding inhabiting our universe and that transhumanity may be its own worst enemy. Despite all of the technological tools and advances available to future transhumans, they still face terrors like losing control of their own identities, their perceptions, and their mental faculties—not to mention their future as a species.

Eclipse Phase takes all of these themes and weaves them together in a transhuman setting. The post-apocalyptic angle covers the understanding of all that transhumanity has lost, the fight against extinction, and how much of that is a struggle against our own nature. The conspiracy side delves into the nature of the secret organizations that play key roles in determining transhumanity’s future and how the actions of determined individuals can change the lives of many. The horror perspective explores the results of humanity’s self-inflicted transformations and how some of these changes effectively make us non-human. Tying it all together is an awareness of the massive indifference and the terrible *alien-ness* that pervades the universe and how transhumanity is insignificant against such a backdrop.

Offsetting these themes, however, *Eclipse Phase* also asserts that there is hope, that there is something worth fighting for, and that transhumanity can and will pave its own path toward the future.

### BUT HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PLAY?

To play a game of *Eclipse Phase*, you need the following:

- A group of players and a place to meet (real life or online!)
- One player to act as the gamemaster
- The contents of this book
- Something for everyone to take notes with (notepads, laptops, whatever!)
- Two 10-sided dice per player (or a digital equivalent)
- Imagination

### A GROUP OF PLAYERS AND A PLACE TO MEET

While roleplaying games are flexible enough to allow
any number of people, most gaming groups number
around four to eight players. That number of people
brings a good mix of personalities to the table and
ensures great cooperative play.

Once a group of players have determined to play
*Eclipse Phase*, they’ll need to designate someone as
the gamemaster (see below). Then they’ll need to
determine a time and place to meet.

Most roleplaying groups meet once a week at a regularly scheduled time and place: 7:00 PM, Thursday
night, Rob’s house, for example. However, each group
determines where, how they’ll play, and how often.
One group may decide they can only get together
once a month, while another group is so excited to
dive into the story potential of *Eclipse Phase* that
they want to meet twice a week (they decide to rotate
between their houses, though, so as not to overload a
particular player). If a group is lucky enough to have a
favorite local gaming store that supports in-store play,
the group might meet there. Other gaming groups
meet in libraries, common rooms at their school,
bookstores that have generously sized “reading
rooms,” quiet restaurants, and so on. Whatever fit
for your gaming group, make it work!

When getting together for a game, most RPGs
use the phrase “gaming session.” The length of
each gaming session is completely dependent upon
the consensus of the playing group, as well as the
limitations of the locale where they’re playing. The
particular story that unfolds in a given session can
also impact a session’s length. If playing in a game
store, the group may only have a four-hour slot and
the gamemaster and group may have determined—
through several sessions of play—that this is a perfect
time frame to enjoy the story they’re participating in
each week. Another group, however, may want an
even shorter length of time. Yet another group may
decide that while they’ll usually do four-hour sessions,
once a month they’ll set aside an entire Saturday for
a great all-day gaming session. Players will need to
dive in and start playing and be fl xible to decide
what will provide the ultimate enjoyment for their
gaming group.

While the camaraderie of a shared experience of
playing face-to-face with a group of friends remains
the strength of roleplaying games, groups need not
confine themselves to a single mode of play. There are
myriad options that can be used. Email, instant mes-
sages, message boards, video chats, phone/voip calls,
text messages, wikis, (micro-)blogs: any and all of
these can be utilized to play the game without having
warm bodies in seats directly across the table from
one another.

Finally, when playing groups meet for the first time,
they should generate their characters (as opposed to
generating characters by themselves). While a gaming
group can decide to generate characters individually,
often it is far easier once the players are together.
This allows those more experienced to help those new
to RPGs. Even more important, it enables the entire
group to tailor the characters so there is not too
much overlap in capabilities and style. After all, with
the wealth of character opportunities available, you
don’t want to show up at the table with an almost
identical character to the player next to you.

### THE GAMEMASTER

Once a group has been organized, someone needs to
step up and take the reins of the gamemaster. Some
groups have a single gamemaster that runs all their
gaming sessions month after month. Other groups
rotate a gamemaster, with a single person running
a given portion of the unfolding story for several
games before handing the work off to another player.
Once again, the participants should be flexible Some
groups may have the perfect person who loves the
work involved and is more than willing to run session
after session, while other groups may decide that they
all want to take turns both as the gamemaster and
as players.

The gamemaster controls the story. They keep track
of what is supposed to happen when, describe events
as they occur so that the players (as characters) can
react to them, keep track of other characters in the
game (referred to as non-player characters, or NPCs),
and resolve attempts to take action using the game
system. The game system comes into play when characters seek to use their skills or otherwise do something that requires a test to see whether or not they
succeed. Specific rules are presented for situations that
involve rolling dice to determine the outcome 
([see the *Game Mechanics* chapter](../03/00-game-mechanics.md)).

The gamemaster describes the world as the characters
 see it, functioning as their eyes, ears, and
other senses. Gamemastering is not easy, but the
thrill of creating an adventure that engages the other
players’ imaginations, testing their gaming skills and
their characters’ skills in the game world, makes
it worthwhile. Posthuman Studios will follow the
publication of *Eclipse Phase* with supporting supplements
and adventures to help this process along,
but experienced gamemasters can always adapt
the game universe to suit their own styles. In fact,
since *Eclipse Phase* is published under a Creative
Commons license, (see [license](../../../license.md)), players are encouraged
to tailor the universe to their style of play and also
to share that with other players. You never know
when a specific choice you’ve made in the running of
a campaign is exactly what another gamemaster and
his group is looking for.
