## How do I know what's hombrew and what's not?

In running text hombrew is indicated with **HB**: *This is homebrew*, and this isn't

#### HB:This section is hombrew
All the content under the heading is homebrew.

##### A Subsection
Subsection inside a homebrew section is still homebrew but doesn't contain any additional indicator.

#### New section
While subsection still would belong to the homebrew material, new section doesn't

##### HB: Subsection
But they may contain subsections of homebrew material like this.
